https://doi.org/10.1145/3362505,Geographic Diversification of Recommended POIs in Frequently Visited Areas,"In the personalized Point-Of-Interest (POI) (or venue) recommendation, the diversity of recommended POIs is an important aspect. Diversity is especially important when POIs are recommended in the target users’ frequently visited areas, because users are likely to revisit such areas. In addition to the (POI) category diversity that is a popular diversification objective in recommendation domains, diversification of recommended POI locations is an interesting subject itself. Despite its importance, existing POI recommender studies generally focus on and evaluate prediction accuracy. In this article, geographical diversification (geo-diversification), a novel diversification concept that aims to increase recommendation coverage for a target users’ geographic areas of interest, is introduced, from which a method that improves geo-diversity as an addition to existing state-of-the-art POI recommenders is proposed. In experiments with the datasets from two real Location Based Social Networks (LSBNs), we first analyze the performance of four state-of-the-art POI recommenders from various evaluation perspectives including category diversity and geo-diversity that have not been examined previously. The proposed method consistently improves geo-diversity (CPR(geo)@20) by 5 to 12% when combined with four state-of-the-art POI recommenders with negligible prediction accuracy ([email protected]) loss and provides 6 to 18% geo-diversity improvement with tolerable prediction accuracy loss  (up to 2.4%).","[{""name"":""Jungkyu Han"",""id"":""/profile/99658995151""},{""name"":""Hayato Yamana"",""id"":""/profile/81100327663""},{""name"":""Jungkyu Han"",""id"":""/profile/99658995151""},{""name"":""Hayato Yamana"",""id"":""/profile/81100327663""}]","[""Panagiotis Adamopoulos and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3362651,"Understanding Assimilation-contrast Effects in Online Rating Systems: Modelling, Debiasing, and Applications","“Unbiasedness,” which is an important property to ensure that users’ ratings indeed reflect their true evaluations of products, is vital both in shaping consumer purchase decisions and providing reliable recommendations in online rating systems. Recent experimental studies showed that distortions from historical ratings would ruin the unbiasedness of subsequent ratings. How to “discover” historical distortions in each single rating (or at the micro-level), and perform the “debiasing operations” are our main objective. Using 42M real customer ratings, we first show that users either “assimilate” or “contrast” to historical ratings under different scenarios, which can be further explained by a well-known psychological argument: the “Assimilate-Contrast” theory. This motivates us to propose the Historical Influence Aware Latent Factor Model (HIALF), the “first” model for real rating systems to capture and mitigate historical distortions in each single rating. HIALF allows us to study the influence patterns of historical ratings from a modelling perspective, which perfectly matches the assimilation and contrast effects observed in experiments. Moreover, HIALF achieves significant improvements in predicting subsequent ratings and characterizing relationships in ratings. It also contributes to better recommendations, wiser consumer purchase decisions, and deeper understanding of historical distortions in both honest rating and misbehaving rating settings.","[{""name"":""Xiaoying Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659195565""},{""name"":""Hong Xie"",""id"":""/profile/89758756357""},{""name"":""Junzhou Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/82458731157""},{""name"":""John C.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3361217,BoRe: Adapting to Reader Consumption Behavior Instability for News Recommendation,"News recommendation has become an essential way to help readers discover interesting stories. While a growing line of research has focused on modeling reading preferences for news recommendation, they neglect the instability of reader consumption behaviors, i.e., consumption behaviors of readers may be influenced by other factors in addition to user interests, which degrades the recommendation effectiveness of existing methods. In this article, we propose a probabilistic generative model, BoRe, where user interests and crowd effects are used to adapt to the instability of reader consumption behaviors, and reading sequences are utilized to adapt user interests evolving over time. Further, the extreme sparsity problem in the domain of news severely hinders accurately modeling user interests and reading sequences, which discounts BoRe’s ability to adapt to the instability. Accordingly, we leverage domain-specific features to model user interests in the situation of extreme sparsity. Meanwhile, we consider groups of users instead of individuals to capture reading sequences. Besides, we study how to reduce the computation to allow online application. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of BoRe on real-world datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of BoRe, compared with the state-of-the-art competing methods.","[{""name"":""Pengtao Lv"",""id"":""/profile/99659475254""},{""name"":""Xiangwu Meng"",""id"":""/profile/81418597930""},{""name"":""Yujie Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659497206""},{""name"":""Pengtao Lv"",""id"":""/profile/99659475254""},{""name"":""Xiangwu Meng"",""id"":""/profile/81418597930""},{""name"":""Yujie Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659497206""}]","[""Chong Wang.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3361738,Explainable Product Search with a Dynamic Relation Embedding Model,"Product search is one of the most popular methods for customers to discover products online. Most existing studies on product search focus on developing effective retrieval models that rank items by their likelihood to be purchased. However, they ignore the problem that there is a gap between how systems and customers perceive the relevance of items. Without explanations, users may not understand why product search engines retrieve certain items for them, which consequentially leads to imperfect user experience and suboptimal system performance in practice. In this work, we tackle this problem by constructing explainable retrieval models for product search. Specifically, we propose to model the “search and purchase” behavior as a dynamic relation between users and items, and create a dynamic knowledge graph based on both the multi-relational product data and the context of the search session. Ranking is conducted based on the relationship between users and items in the latent space, and explanations are generated with logic inferences and entity soft matching on the knowledge graph. Empirical experiments show that our model, which we refer to as the Dynamic Relation Embedding Model (DREM), significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and has the ability to produce reasonable explanations for search results.","[{""name"":""Qingyao Ai"",""id"":""/profile/99658751310""},{""name"":""Yongfeng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659562138""},{""name"":""Keping Bi"",""id"":""/profile/81496668691""},{""name"":""W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3361719,A Multi-Label Classification Method Using a Hierarchical and Transparent Representation for Paper-Reviewer Recommendation,"The paper-reviewer recommendation task is of significant academic importance for conference chairs and journal editors. It aims to recommend appropriate experts in a discipline to comment on the quality of papers of others in that discipline. How to effectively and accurately recommend reviewers for the submitted papers is a meaningful and still tough task. Generally, the relationship between a paper and a reviewer often depends on the semantic expressions of them. Creating a more expressive representation can make the peer-review process more robust and less arbitrary. So the representations of a paper and a reviewer are very important for the paper-reviewer recommendation. Actually, a reviewer or a paper often belongs to multiple research fields, which increases difficulty in paper-reviewer recommendation. In this article, we propose a Multi-Label Classification method using a HIErarchical and transPArent Representation named Hiepar-MLC. First, we introduce HIErarchical and transPArent Representation (Hiepar) to express the semantic information of the reviewer and the paper. Hiepar is learned from a two-level bidirectional gated recurrent unit based network applying the attention mechanism. It is capable of capturing the two-level hierarchical information (word-sentence-document) and highlighting the elements in reviewers or papers to support the labels. This word-sentence-document information mirrors the hierarchical structure of a reviewer or a paper and captures the exact semantics of them. Then we transform the paper-reviewer recommendation problem into a multi-level classification issue, whose multiple research labels exactly guide the learning process. It is flexible in that we can select any multi-label classification method to solve the paper-reviewer recommendation problem. Further, we propose a simple multi-label-based reviewer assignment (MLBRA) strategy to select the appropriate reviewers. It is interesting in that we also explore the paper-reviewer recommendation in the coarse-grain granularity. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset consisting of the papers in the ACM Digital Library show that Hiepar-MLC achieves better label prediction performance than the existing representation alternatives. In addition, with the MLBRA strategy, we show the effectiveness and the feasibility of our transformation from paper-reviewer recommendation to multi-label classification.","[{""name"":""Dong Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659284143""},{""name"":""Shu Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81442602591""},{""name"":""Zhen Duan"",""id"":""/profile/99658971237""},{""name"":""Jie Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81490682983""},{""name"":""Yanping Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81442601683""},{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""},{""name"":""Dong Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659284143""},{""name"":""Shu Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81442602591""},{""name"":""Zhen Duan"",""id"":""/profile/99658971237""},{""name"":""Jie Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81490682983""},{""name"":""Yanping Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81442601683""},{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""}]","[""Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3365211,A Deep Learning Architecture for Psychometric Natural Language Processing,"Psychometric measures reflecting people’s knowledge, ability, attitudes, and personality traits are critical for many real-world applications, such as e-commerce, health care, and cybersecurity. However, traditional methods cannot collect and measure rich psychometric dimensions in a timely and unobtrusive manner. Consequently, despite their importance, psychometric dimensions have received limited attention from the natural language processing and information retrieval communities. In this article, we propose a deep learning architecture, PyNDA, to extract psychometric dimensions from user-generated texts. PyNDA contains a novel representation embedding, a demographic embedding, a structural equation model (SEM) encoder, and a multitask learning mechanism designed to work in unison to address the unique challenges associated with extracting rich, sophisticated, and user-centric psychometric dimensions. Our experiments on three real-world datasets encompassing 11 psychometric dimensions, including trust, anxiety, and literacy, show that PyNDA markedly outperforms traditional feature-based classifiers as well as the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Ablation analysis reveals that each component of PyNDA significantly contributes to its overall performance. Collectively, the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architecture for facilitating rich psychometric analysis. Our results have important implications for user-centric information extraction and retrieval systems looking to measure and incorporate psychometric dimensions.","[{""name"":""Faizan Ahmad"",""id"":""/profile/99659503855""},{""name"":""Ahmed Abbasi"",""id"":""/profile/81350596005""},{""name"":""Jingjing Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659504304""},{""name"":""David G.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3366172,Next-Item Recommendation via Collaborative Filtering with Bidirectional Item Similarity,"Exploiting temporal effect has empirically been recognized as a promising way to improve recommendation performance in recent years. In real-world applications, one-class data in the form of (user, item, timestamp) are usually more accessible and abundant than numerical ratings. In this article, we focus on exploiting such one-class data in order to provide personalized next-item recommendation services. Specifically, we base our work on the framework of time-aware item-based collaborative filtering and propose a simple yet effective similarity measurement called bidirectional item similarity (BIS) that is able to capture sequential patterns even from noisy data. Furthermore, we extend BIS via some factorization techniques and obtain an adaptive version, i.e., adaptive BIS (ABIS), in order to better fit the behavioral data. We also design a compound weighting function that leverages the complementarity between two well-known time-aware weighting functions. With the proposed similarity measurements and weighting function, we obtain two novel collaborative filtering methods that are able to achieve significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art methods, showcasing their effectiveness for next-item recommendation.","[{""name"":""Zijie Zeng"",""id"":""/profile/99659489362""},{""name"":""Jing Lin"",""id"":""/profile/99659489406""},{""name"":""Lin Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659463563""},{""name"":""Weike Pan"",""id"":""/profile/99658657571""},{""name"":""Zhong Ming"",""id"":""/profile/81100136462""},{""name"":""Zijie Zeng"",""id"":""/profile/99659489362""},{""name"":""Jing Lin"",""id"":""/profile/99659489406""},{""name"":""Lin Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659463563""},{""name"":""Weike Pan"",""id"":""/profile/99658657571""},{""name"":""Zhong Ming"",""id"":""/profile/81100136462""}]","[""Da Cao, Xiangnan He, Liqiang Nie, Xiaochi Wei, Xia Hu, Shunxiang Wu, and Tat-Seng Chua. 2017.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3368960,Emotional Conversation Generation Based on a Bayesian Deep Neural Network,"The field of conversation generation using neural networks has attracted increasing attention from researchers for several years. However, traditional neural language models tend to generate a generic reply with poor semantic logic and no emotion. This article proposes an emotional conversation generation model based on a Bayesian deep neural network that can generate replies with rich emotions, clear themes, and diverse sentences. The topic and emotional keywords of the replies are pregenerated by introducing commonsense knowledge in the model. The reply is divided into multiple clauses, and then a multidimensional generator based on the transformer mechanism proposed in this article is used to iteratively generate clauses from two dimensions: sentence granularity and sentence structure. Subjective and objective experiments prove that compared with existing models, the proposed model effectively improves the semantic logic and emotional accuracy of replies. This model also significantly enhances the diversity of replies, largely overcoming the shortcomings of traditional models that generate safe replies.","[{""name"":""Xiao Sun"",""id"":""/profile/81485646782""},{""name"":""Jia Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659487197""},{""name"":""Xing Wei"",""id"":""/profile/99659520378""},{""name"":""Changliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659487074""},{""name"":""Jianhua Tao"",""id"":""/profile/81100159562""},{""name"":""Xiao Sun"",""id"":""/profile/81485646782""},{""name"":""Jia Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659487197""},{""name"":""Xing Wei"",""id"":""/profile/99659520378""},{""name"":""Changliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659487074""},{""name"":""Jianhua Tao"",""id"":""/profile/81100159562""}]","[""M.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3371707,The Effects of Task Complexity on the Use of Different Types of Information in a Search Assistance Tool,"In interactive information retrieval, an important research question is: How do task characteristics influence users’ needs and behaviors? We report on a laboratory study (N=32) that investigated the effects of task complexity on the types of information used by participants while searching. Participants completed tasks of four complexity levels and had access to four different types of information provided through a search-assistance tool referred to as the InfoBoxes (IB). The IB tool presented the following types of task-related information (info-types) on different tabs: (1) facts, (2) concepts, (3) opinions, and (4) insights. Facts (and opinions) were defined as objective (and subjective) statements relevant to the task. Concepts were defined as important ideas, principles, or entities related to the task. Insights were defined as tips or advice about the task. The study investigated six research questions that considered the effects of task complexity on: (RQ1) participants’ pre-/post-task perceptions about useful info-types; (RQ2) use of different info-types during the task; (RQ3) motivations for engaging with the IB; (RQ4) gains from using it; (RQ5) the search stage participants were in while engaging with the IB; and (RQ6) motivations for sometimes avoiding the IB. Our results suggest that task complexity influenced all six types of outcomes. We discuss implications of our results for designing search assistance tools and systems that favor certain types of content based on task characteristics.","[{""name"":""Bogeum Choi"",""id"":""/profile/99659281714""},{""name"":""Austin Ward"",""id"":""/profile/99659489099""},{""name"":""Yuan Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659496488""},{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Robert Capra"",""id"":""/profile/81100419460""},{""name"":""Bogeum Choi"",""id"":""/profile/99659281714""},{""name"":""Austin Ward"",""id"":""/profile/99659489099""},{""name"":""Yuan Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659496488""},{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Robert Capra"",""id"":""/profile/81100419460""}]","[""K.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3371390,Investigating Searchers’ Mental Models to Inform Search Explanations,"Modern web search engines use many signals to select and rank results in response to queries. However, searchers’ mental models of search are relatively unsophisticated, hindering their ability to use search engines efficiently and effectively. Annotating results with more in-depth explanations could help, but search engine providers need to know what to explain. To this end, we report on a study of searchers’ mental models of web selection and ranking, with more than 400 respondents to an online survey and 11 face-to-face interviews. Participants volunteered a range of factors and showed good understanding of important concepts such as popularity, wording, and personalization. However, they showed little understanding of recency or diversity and incorrect ideas of payment for ranking. Where there are already explanatory annotations on the results page—such as “ad” markers and keyword highlighting—participants were familiar with ranking concepts. This suggests that further explanatory annotations may be useful.","[{""name"":""Paul Thomas"",""id"":""/profile/81100409727""},{""name"":""Bodo Billerbeck"",""id"":""/profile/81100341960""},{""name"":""Nick Craswell"",""id"":""/profile/81100113287""},{""name"":""Ryen W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3372338,Improving Implicit Recommender Systems with Auxiliary Data,"Most existing recommender systems leverage the primary feedback only, despite the fact that users also generate a large amount of auxiliary feedback. These feedback usually indicate different user preferences when comparing to the primary feedback directly used to optimize the system performance. For example, in E-commerce sites, view data is easily accessible, which provides a valuable yet weaker signal than the primary feedback of purchase. In this work, we improve implicit feedback-based recommender systems (dubbed Implicit Recommender Systems) by integrating auxiliary view data into matrix factorization (MF). To exploit different preference levels, we propose both pointwise and pairwise models in terms of how to leverage users’ viewing behaviors. The latter model learns the pairwise ranking relations among purchased, viewed, and non-viewed interactions, being more effective and flexible than the former pointwise MF method. However, such a pairwise formulation poses a computational efficiency problem in learning the model. To address this problem, we design a new learning algorithm based on the element-wise Alternating Least Squares (eALS) learner. Notably, our designed algorithm can efficiently learn model parameters from the whole user-item matrix (including all missing data), with a rather low time complexity that is dependent on the observed data only. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art MF methods by 6.43%∼ 6.75%.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3372154,Local Variational Feature-Based Similarity Models for Recommending Top-N New Items,"The top-N recommendation problem has been studied extensively. Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms show promising results for the problem. They predict a user’s preferences by estimating similarities between a target and user-rated items. Top-N recommendation remains a challenging task in scenarios where there is a lack of preference history for new items. Feature-based Similarity Models (FSMs) address this particular problem by extending item-based collaborative filtering by estimating similarity functions of item features. The quality of the estimated similarity function determines the accuracy of the recommendation. However, existing FSMs only estimate global similarity functions; i.e., they estimate using preference information across all users. Moreover, the estimated similarity functions are linear; hence, they may fail to capture the complex structure underlying item features.In this article, we propose to improve FSMs by estimating local similarity functions, where each function is estimated for a subset of like-minded users. To capture global preference patterns, we extend the global similarity function from linear to nonlinear, based on the effectiveness of variational autoencoders. We propose a Bayesian generative model, called the Local Variational Feature-based Similarity Model, to encapsulate local and global similarity functions. We present a variational Expectation Minimization algorithm for efficient approximate inference. Extensive experiments on a large number of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.","[{""name"":""Yifan Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659314607""},{""name"":""Yang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659452152""},{""name"":""Xiang Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81758878757""},{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""},{""name"":""Ilya Markov"",""id"":""/profile/81384601729""},{""name"":""MAARTEN De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Yifan Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659314607""},{""name"":""Yang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659452152""},{""name"":""Xiang Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81758878757""},{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""},{""name"":""Ilya Markov"",""id"":""/profile/81384601729""},{""name"":""MAARTEN De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""}]","[""Deepak Agarwal and Bee-Chung Chen. 2009.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3374210,A Price-per-attention Auction Scheme Using Mouse Cursor Information,"Payments in online ad auctions are typically derived from click-through rates, so that advertisers do not pay for ineffective ads. But advertisers often care about more than just clicks. That is, for example, if they aim to raise brand awareness or visibility. There is thus an opportunity to devise a more effective ad pricing paradigm, in which ads are paid only if they are actually noticed. This article contributes a novel auction format based on a pay-per-attention (PPA) scheme. We show that the PPA auction inherits the desirable properties (strategy-proofness and efficiency) as its pay-per-impression and pay-per-click counterparts, and that it also compares favourably in terms of revenues. To make the PPA format feasible, we also contribute a scalable diagnostic technology to predict user attention to ads in sponsored search using raw mouse cursor coordinates only, regardless of the page content and structure. We use the user attention predictions in numerical simulations to evaluate the PPA auction scheme. Our results show that, in relevant economic settings, the PPA revenues would be strictly higher than the existing auction payment schemes.","[{""name"":""Ioannis Arapakis"",""id"":""/profile/81363606440""},{""name"":""Antonio Penta"",""id"":""/profile/99659503152""},{""name"":""Hideo Joho"",""id"":""/profile/81100310348""},{""name"":""Luis A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3373807,Efficient Neural Matrix Factorization without Sampling for Recommendation,"Recommendation systems play a vital role to keep users engaged with personalized contents in modern online platforms. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized many research fields and there is a surge of interest in applying it for recommendation. However, existing studies have largely focused on exploring complex deep-learning architectures for recommendation task, while typically applying the negative sampling strategy for model learning. Despite effectiveness, we argue that these methods suffer from two important limitations: (1) the methods with complex network structures have a substantial number of parameters, and require expensive computations even with a sampling-based learning strategy; (2) the negative sampling strategy is not robust, making sampling-based methods difficult to achieve the optimal performance in practical applications.In this work, we propose to learn neural recommendation models from the whole training data without sampling. However, such a non-sampling strategy poses strong challenges to learning efficiency. To address this, we derive three new optimization methods through rigorous mathematical reasoning, which can efficiently learn model parameters from the whole data (including all missing data) with a rather low time complexity. Moreover, based on a simple Neural Matrix Factorization architecture, we present a general framework named ENMF, short for Efficient Neural Matrix Factorization. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets indicate that the proposed ENMF framework consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the Top-K recommendation task. Remarkably, ENMF also shows significant advantages in training efficiency, which makes it more applicable to real-world large-scale systems.","[{""name"":""Chong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659260143""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Yongfeng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659562138""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Chong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659260143""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Yongfeng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659562138""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""}]","[""Chong Chen, Min Zhang, Yiqun Liu, and Shaoping Ma. 2018.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3376927,An Enhanced Neural Network Approach to Person-Job Fit in Talent Recruitment,"The widespread use of online recruitment services has led to an information explosion in the job market. As a result, recruiters have to seek intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right candidates to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit usually focus on measuring the matching degree between talent qualification and job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts, which could be easily misguided by the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of human judgment. To that end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Topic-based Ability-aware Person-Job Fit Neural Network (TAPJFNN) framework, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labor and can provide better interpretability about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available in abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers’ experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, two hierarchical topic-based ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measure the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. In addition, we design a refinement strategy for Person-Job Fit prediction based on historical recruitment records. Furthermore, we introduce how to exploit our TAPJFNN framework for enabling two specific applications in talent recruitment: talent sourcing and job recommendation. Particularly, in the application of job recommendation, a novel training mechanism is designed for addressing the challenge of biased negative labels. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the TAPJFNN and its variants compared with several baselines.","[{""name"":""Chuan Qin"",""id"":""/profile/99659281492""},{""name"":""Hengshu Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81490670832""},{""name"":""Tong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81550320556""},{""name"":""Chen Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/99658697285""},{""name"":""Chao Ma"",""id"":""/profile/99659309041""},{""name"":""Enhong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81323488612""},{""name"":""Hui Xiong"",""id"":""/profile/81451596433""},{""name"":""Chuan Qin"",""id"":""/profile/99659281492""},{""name"":""Hengshu Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81490670832""},{""name"":""Tong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81550320556""},{""name"":""Chen Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/99658697285""},{""name"":""Chao Ma"",""id"":""/profile/99659309041""},{""name"":""Enhong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81323488612""},{""name"":""Hui Xiong"",""id"":""/profile/81451596433""}]","[""Meenakshi Chaudhary. 2017.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3377850,Jointly Learning Representations of Nodes and Attributes for Attributed Networks,"Previous embedding methods for attributed networks aim at learning low-dimensional vector representations only for nodes but not for both nodes and attributes, resulting in the fact that node embeddings cannot be directly used to recover the correlations between nodes and attributes. However, capturing such correlations by embeddings is of great importance for many real-world applications, such as attribute inference and user profiling. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, many attributed networks evolve over time, with their nodes, links, and attributes changing from time to time. In this article, we study the problem of jointly learning low-dimensional representations of both nodes and attributes for static and dynamic attributed networks. To address this problem, we propose a Co-embedding model for Static Attributed Networks (CSAN), which jointly learns low-dimensional representations of both attributes and nodes in the same semantic space such that their affinities can be effectively captured and measured, and a Co-embedding model for Dynamic Attributed Networks (CDAN) to dynamically track low-dimensional representations of nodes and attributes over time. To obtain effective embeddings, both our co-embedding models, CSAN and CDAN, embed each node and attribute with means and variances of Gaussian distributions via variational auto-encoders. Our CDAN model formulates the dynamic changes of a dynamic attributed network by aggregating perturbation features from the nodes’ local neighborhoods as well as attributes’ associations such that the evolving patterns of the given network can be tracked. Experimental results on real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed embedding models outperform state-of-the-art non-dynamic and dynamic embedding models.","[{""name"":""Zaiqiao Meng"",""id"":""/profile/99659345978""},{""name"":""Shangsong Liang"",""id"":""/profile/81556005056""},{""name"":""Xiangliang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81436599318""},{""name"":""Richard McCreadie"",""id"":""/profile/81438596854""},{""name"":""Iadh Ounis"",""id"":""/profile/81100017083""},{""name"":""Zaiqiao Meng"",""id"":""/profile/99659345978""},{""name"":""Shangsong Liang"",""id"":""/profile/81556005056""},{""name"":""Xiangliang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81436599318""},{""name"":""Richard McCreadie"",""id"":""/profile/81438596854""},{""name"":""Iadh Ounis"",""id"":""/profile/81100017083""}]","[""David M.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3377550,Learning Semantic Representations from Directed Social Links to Tag Microblog Users at Scale,"This article presents a network embedding approach to automatically generate tags for microblog users. Instead of using text data, we aim to annotate microblog users with meaningful tags by leveraging rich social link data. To utilize directed social links, we use two kinds of node representations for modeling user interest in terms of their followers and followees, respectively. To alleviate the sparsity problem, we propose a novel method based on two transformation functions for capturing implicit interest similarity. Different from previous works on capturing high-order proximity, our model is able to directly characterize the effect of the context user on the proximity of node pairs. Another novelty of our model is that the importance scores of users learned from the classic PageRank algorithm are utilized to set the link weights. By using such weights, our model is more capable of disentangling the interest similarity evidence of a link. We jointly consider the above factors when designing the final objective function.We construct a very large evaluation set consisting of 2.6M users, 0.5M tags, and 0.8B following links. To our knowledge, it is the largest reported dataset for microblog user tagging in the literature. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We implement this approach with several optimization techniques, which makes our model easy to scale to very large social networks. Ubiquitous social links provide important data resources to understand user interests. Our work provides an effective and efficient solution to annotate user interests solely using the link data, which has important practical value in industry. To illustrate the use of our models, we implement a demonstration system for visualizing, navigating, and searching microblog users.","[{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Yupeng Hou"",""id"":""/profile/99659509421""},{""name"":""Junhua Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659509019""},{""name"":""Jonathan J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3379340,Emotion Dynamics of Public Opinions on Twitter,"Recently, social media has been considered the fastest medium for information broadcasting and sharing. Considering the wide range of applications such as viral marketing, political campaigns, social advertisement, and so on, influencing characteristics of users or tweets have attracted several researchers. It is observed from various studies that influential messages or users create a high impact on a social ecosystem. In this study, we assume that public opinion on a social issue on Twitter carries a certain degree of emotion, and there is an emotion flow underneath the Twitter network. In this article, we investigate social dynamics of emotion present in users’ opinions and attempt to understand (i) changing characteristics of users’ emotions toward a social issue over time, (ii) influence of public emotions on individuals’ emotions, (iii) cause of changing opinion by social factors, and so on. We study users’ emotion dynamics over a collection of 17.65M tweets with 69.36K users and observe 63% of the users are likely to change their emotional state against the topic into their subsequent tweets. Tweets were coming from the member community shows higher influencing capability than the other community sources. It is also observed that retweets influence users more than hashtags, mentions, and replies.","[{""name"":""Debashis Naskar"",""id"":""/profile/99659507027""},{""name"":""Sanasam Ranbir Singh"",""id"":""/profile/81542024756""},{""name"":""Durgesh Kumar"",""id"":""/profile/99659508725""},{""name"":""Sukumar Nandi"",""id"":""/profile/81409591707""},{""name"":""Eva Onaindia de la Rivaherrera"",""id"":""/profile/99659508718""},{""name"":""Debashis Naskar"",""id"":""/profile/99659507027""},{""name"":""Sanasam Ranbir Singh"",""id"":""/profile/81542024756""},{""name"":""Durgesh Kumar"",""id"":""/profile/99659508725""},{""name"":""Sukumar Nandi"",""id"":""/profile/81409591707""},{""name"":""Eva Onaindia de la Rivaherrera"",""id"":""/profile/99659508718""}]","[""Saifuddin Ahmed, Kokil Jaidka, and Jaeho Cho. 2017.

Considering that it is a common case that students inevitably learn and forget knowledge from time to time, it is necessary to track the change of their knowledge proficiency during the learning process. Existing approaches either relied on static scenarios or ignored the interpretability of diagnosis results. To address these problems, in this article, we present a focused study on diagnosing the knowledge proficiency of students, where the goal is to track and explain their evolutions simultaneously. Specifically, we first devise an explanatory probabilistic matrix factorization model, Knowledge Proficiency Tracing (KPT), by leveraging educational priors. KPT model first associates each exercise with a knowledge vector in which each element represents a specific knowledge concept with the help of Q-matrix. Correspondingly, at each time, each student can be represented as a proficiency vector in the same knowledge space. Then, our KPT model jointly applies two classical educational theories (i.e., learning curve and forgetting curve) to capture the change of students’ proficiency level on concepts over time. Furthermore, for improving the predictive performance, we develop an improved version of KPT, named Exercise-correlated Knowledge Proficiency Tracing (EKPT), by considering the connectivity among exercises with the same knowledge concepts. Finally, we apply our KPT and EKPT models to three important diagnostic tasks, including knowledge estimation, score prediction, and diagnosis result visualization. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that both of our models could track the knowledge proficiency of students effectively and interpretatively.","[{""name"":""Zhenya Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99659086161""},{""name"":""Qi Liu"",""id"":""/profile/83358683257""},{""name"":""Yuying Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659218609""},{""name"":""Le Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659045608""},{""name"":""Keli Xiao"",""id"":""/profile/81361599393""},{""name"":""Enhong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81323488612""},{""name"":""Haiping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81501674573""},{""name"":""Guoping Hu"",""id"":""/profile/81440592996""},{""name"":""Zhenya Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99659086161""},{""name"":""Qi Liu"",""id"":""/profile/83358683257""},{""name"":""Yuying Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659218609""},{""name"":""Le Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659045608""},{""name"":""Keli Xiao"",""id"":""/profile/81361599393""},{""name"":""Enhong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81323488612""},{""name"":""Haiping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81501674573""},{""name"":""Guoping Hu"",""id"":""/profile/81440592996""}]","[""Ashton Anderson, Daniel Huttenlocher, Jon Kleinberg, and Jure Leskovec. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3380954,Large-Scale Question Tagging via Joint Question-Topic Embedding Learning,"Recent years have witnessed a flourishing of community-driven question answering (cQA), like Yahoo! Answers and AnswerBag, where people can seek precise information. After 2010, some novel cQA systems, including Quora and Zhihu, gained momentum. Besides interactions, the latter enables users to label the questions with topic tags that highlight the key points conveyed in the questions. In this article, we shed light on automatically annotating a newly posted question with topic tags that are predefined and preorganized into a directed acyclic graph. To accomplish this task, we present an end-to-end deep interactive embedding model to jointly learn the embeddings of questions and topics by projecting them into the same space for a similarity measure. In particular, we first learn the embeddings of questions and topic tags by two deep parallel models. Thereinto, we regularize the embeddings of topic tags via fully exploring their hierarchical structures, which is able to alleviate the problem of imbalanced topic distribution. Thereafter, we interact each question embedding with the topic tag matrix, i.e., all the topic tag embeddings. Following that, a sigmoid cross-entropy loss is appended to reward the positive question-topic pairs and penalize the negative ones. To justify our model, we have conducted extensive experiments on an unprecedented large-scale social QA dataset obtained from Zhihu.com, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance to several state-of-the-art baselines.","[{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Yongqi Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659475827""},{""name"":""Fuli Feng"",""id"":""/profile/99659190553""},{""name"":""Xuemeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99658613490""},{""name"":""Meng Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81351595589""},{""name"":""Yinglong Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659245168""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Yongqi Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659475827""},{""name"":""Fuli Feng"",""id"":""/profile/99659190553""},{""name"":""Xuemeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99658613490""},{""name"":""Meng Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81351595589""},{""name"":""Yinglong Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659245168""}]","[""Fabiano Belém, Eder Martins, Tatiana Pontes, Jussara Almeida, and Marcos Gonçalves. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3383123,Challenges in Building Intelligent Open-domain Dialog Systems,"There is a resurgent interest in developing intelligent open-domain dialog systems due to the availability of large amounts of conversational data and the recent progress on neural approaches to conversational AI [33]. Unlike traditional task-oriented bots, an open-domain dialog system aims to establish long-term connections with users by satisfying the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. This article reviews the recent work on neural approaches that are devoted to addressing three challenges in developing such systems: semantics, consistency, and interactiveness. Semantics requires a dialog system to not only understand the content of the dialog but also identify users’ emotional and social needs during the conversation. Consistency requires the system to demonstrate a consistent personality to win users’ trust and gain their long-term confidence. Interactiveness refers to the system’s ability to generate interpersonal responses to achieve particular social goals such as entertainment and conforming. The studies we select to present in this survey are based on our unique views and are by no means complete. Nevertheless, we hope that the discussion will inspire new research in developing more intelligent open-domain dialog systems.","[{""name"":""Minlie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81430592684""},{""name"":""Xiaoyan Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81438595316""},{""name"":""Jianfeng Gao"",""id"":""/profile/81363593892""},{""name"":""Minlie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81430592684""},{""name"":""Xiaoyan Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81438595316""},{""name"":""Jianfeng Gao"",""id"":""/profile/81363593892""}]","[""Daniel Adiwardana, Minh-Thang Luong, David R.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3382764,Exploiting Cross-session Information for Session-based Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks,"Different from the traditional recommender system, the session-based recommender system introduces the concept of the session, i.e., a sequence of interactions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the user’s recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender system mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions, which are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency relationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session information due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between different sessions is prevented. In this article, we solve these problems with the graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a graph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full Graph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency. To exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual session’s representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected Session (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout function to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e., Yoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.","[{""name"":""Ruihong Qiu"",""id"":""/profile/99659477201""},{""name"":""Zi Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81317494890""},{""name"":""Jingjing Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658959453""},{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""},{""name"":""Ruihong Qiu"",""id"":""/profile/99659477201""},{""name"":""Zi Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81317494890""},{""name"":""Jingjing Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658959453""},{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""}]","[""Ting Bai, Jian-Yun Nie, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yutao Zhu, Pan Du, and Ji-Rong Wen. 2018.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3385186,OutdoorSent: Sentiment Analysis of Urban Outdoor Images by Using Semantic and Deep Features,"Opinion mining in outdoor images posted by users during different activities can provide valuable information to better understand urban areas. In this regard, we propose a framework to classify the sentiment of outdoor images shared by users on social networks. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art ConvNet architectures and one specifically designed for sentiment analysis. We also evaluate how the merging of deep features and semantic information derived from the scene attributes can improve classification and cross-dataset generalization performance. The evaluation explores a novel dataset—namely, OutdoorSent—and other publicly available datasets. We observe that the incorporation of knowledge about semantic attributes improves the accuracy of all ConvNet architectures studied. Besides, we found that exploring only images related to the context of the study—outdoor, in our case—is recommended, i.e., indoor images were not significantly helpful. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of our results in the United States city of Chicago, Illinois, showing that they can help to improve the knowledge of subjective characteristics of different areas of the city. For instance, particular areas of the city tend to concentrate more images of a specific class of sentiment, which are also correlated with median income, opening up opportunities in different fields.","[{""name"":""Wyverson Bonasoli de Oliveira"",""id"":""/profile/99659528244""},{""name"":""Leyza Baldo Dorini"",""id"":""/profile/81375608327""},{""name"":""Rodrigo Minetto"",""id"":""/profile/81339517568""},{""name"":""Thiago H.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3385670,Safe Exploration for Optimizing Contextual Bandits,"Contextual bandit problems are a natural fit for many information retrieval tasks, such as learning to rank, text classification, recommendation, and so on. However, existing learning methods for contextual bandit problems have one of two drawbacks: They either do not explore the space of all possible document rankings (i.e., actions) and, thus, may miss the optimal ranking, or they present suboptimal rankings to a user and, thus, may harm the user experience. We introduce a new learning method for contextual bandit problems, Safe Exploration Algorithm (SEA), which overcomes the above drawbacks. SEA starts by using a baseline (or production) ranking system (i.e., policy), which does not harm the user experience and, thus, is safe to execute but has suboptimal performance and, thus, needs to be improved. Then SEA uses counterfactual learning to learn a new policy based on the behavior of the baseline policy. SEA also uses high-confidence off-policy evaluation to estimate the performance of the newly learned policy. Once the performance of the newly learned policy is at least as good as the performance of the baseline policy, SEA starts using the new policy to execute new actions, allowing it to actively explore favorable regions of the action space. This way, SEA never performs worse than the baseline policy and, thus, does not harm the user experience, while still exploring the action space and, thus, being able to find an optimal policy. Our experiments using text classification and document retrieval confirm the above by comparing SEA (and a boundless variant called BSEA) to online and offline learning methods for contextual bandit problems.","[{""name"":""Rolf Jagerman"",""id"":""/profile/99659192210""},{""name"":""Ilya Markov"",""id"":""/profile/81384601729""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Rolf Jagerman"",""id"":""/profile/99659192210""},{""name"":""Ilya Markov"",""id"":""/profile/81384601729""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius, Ramesh Sankaranarayanan, Shahana Sen, and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3386253,FNED: A Deep Network for Fake News Early Detection on Social Media,"The fast spreading of fake news stories on social media can cause inestimable social harm. Developing effective methods to detect them early is of paramount importance. A major challenge of fake news early detection is fully utilizing the limited data observed at the early stage of news propagation and then learning useful patterns from it for identifying fake news. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network to detect fake news early. It has three novel components: (1) a status-sensitive crowd response feature extractor that extracts both text features and user features from combinations of users’ text response and their corresponding user profiles, (2) a position-aware attention mechanism that highlights important user responses at specific ranking positions, and (3) a multi-region mean-pooling mechanism to perform feature aggregation based on multiple window sizes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with greater than 90% accuracy within 5 minutes after it starts to spread and before it is retweeted 50 times, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines. Most importantly, our approach requires only 10% labeled fake news samples to achieve this effectiveness under PU-Learning settings.","[{""name"":""Yang Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99658654399""},{""name"":""Yi-Fang Brook Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659528668""},{""name"":""Yang Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99658654399""},{""name"":""Yi-Fang Brook Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659528668""}]","[""Sadia Afroz, Michael Brennan, and Rachel Greenstadt. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3388870,Keeping the Data Lake in Form: Proximity Mining for Pre-Filtering Schema Matching,"Data lakes (DLs) are large repositories of raw datasets from disparate sources. As more datasets are ingested into a DL, there is an increasing need for efficient techniques to profile them and to detect the relationships among their schemata, commonly known as holistic schema matching. Schema matching detects similarity between the information stored in the datasets to support information discovery and retrieval. Currently, this is computationally expensive with the volume of state-of-the-art DLs. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early-pruning approach to improve efficiency, where we collect different types of content metadata and schema metadata about the datasets, and then use this metadata in early-pruning steps to pre-filter the schema matching comparisons. This involves computing proximities between datasets based on their metadata, discovering their relationships based on overall proximities and proposing similar dataset pairs for schema matching. We improve the effectiveness of this task by introducing a supervised mining approach for effectively detecting similar datasets that are proposed for further schema matching. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world DL that proves the success of our approach in effectively detecting similar datasets for schema matching, with recall rates of more than 85% and efficiency improvements above 70%. We empirically show the computational cost saving in space and time by applying our approach in comparison to instance-based schema matching techniques.","[{""name"":""Ayman Alserafi"",""id"":""/profile/99659531462""},{""name"":""Alberto Abelló"",""id"":""/profile/81100283421""},{""name"":""Oscar Romero"",""id"":""/profile/81340492232""},{""name"":""Toon Calders"",""id"":""/profile/81100650328""},{""name"":""Ayman Alserafi"",""id"":""/profile/99659531462""},{""name"":""Alberto Abelló"",""id"":""/profile/81100283421""},{""name"":""Oscar Romero"",""id"":""/profile/81340492232""},{""name"":""Toon Calders"",""id"":""/profile/81100650328""}]","[""Ziawasch Abedjan, Lukasz Golab, and Felix Naumann. 2015.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3388640,Towards Question-based High-recall Information Retrieval: Locating the Last Few Relevant Documents for Technology-assisted Reviews,"While continuous active learning algorithms have proven effective in finding most of the relevant documents in a collection, the cost for locating the last few remains high for applications such as Technology-assisted Reviews (TAR). To locate these last few but significant documents efficiently, Zou et al. [2018] have proposed a novel interactive algorithm. The algorithm is based on constructing questions about the presence or absence of entities in the missing relevant documents. The hypothesis made is that entities play a central role in documents carrying key information and that the users are able to answer questions about the presence or absence of an entity in the missing relevance documents. Based on this, a Sequential Bayesian Search-based approach that selects the optimal sequence of questions to ask was devised. In this work, we extend Zou et al. [2018] by (a) investigating the noise tolerance of the proposed algorithm; (b) proposing an alternative objective function to optimize, which accounts for user “erroneous” answers; (c) proposing a method that sequentially decides the best point to stop asking questions to the user; and (d) conducting a small user study to validate some of the assumptions made by Zou et al. [2018]. Furthermore, all experiments are extended to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms not only in the phase of abstract appraisal (i.e., finding the abstracts of potentially relevant documents in a collection) but also finding the documents to be included in the review (i.e., finding the subset of those relevant abstracts for which the article remains relevant). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can greatly improve performance, requiring reviewing fewer irrelevant documents to find the last relevant ones compared to state-of-the-art methods, even in the case of noisy answers. Further, they show that our algorithm learns to stop asking questions at the right time. Last, we conduct a small user study involving an expert reviewer. The user study validates some of the assumptions made in this work regarding the user’s willingness to answer the system questions and the extent of it, as well as the ability of the user to answer these questions.","[{""name"":""Jie Zou"",""id"":""/profile/99659281540""},{""name"":""Evangelos Kanoulas"",""id"":""/profile/81100071997""},{""name"":""Jie Zou"",""id"":""/profile/99659281540""},{""name"":""Evangelos Kanoulas"",""id"":""/profile/81100071997""}]","[""Mustafa Abualsaud, Nimesh Ghelani, Haotian Zhang, Mark D.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3388924,Nonuniform Hyper-Network Embedding with Dual Mechanism,"Network embedding which aims to learn the low-dimensional representations for vertices in networks has been extensively studied in recent years. Although there are various models designed for networks with different properties and different structures for different tasks, most of them are only applied to normal networks which only contain pairwise relationships between vertices. In many realistic cases, relationships among objects are not pairwise and such relationships can be better modeled by a hyper-network in which each edge can connect an uncertain number of vertices. In this article, we focus on two properties of hyper-networks: nonuniform and dual property. In order to make full use of these two properties, we firstly propose a flexible model called Hyper2vec to learn the embeddings of hyper-networks by applying a biased second order random walk strategy to hyper-networks in the framework of Skip-gram. Then, we combine the features of hyperedges by considering the dual hyper-networks to build a further model called NHNE based on 1D convolutional neural networks, and train a tuplewise similarity function for the nonuniform relationships in hyper-networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our methods for hyper-network embedding.","[{""name"":""Jie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99659477683""},{""name"":""Chuan Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659278791""},{""name"":""Fanghua Ye"",""id"":""/profile/99659201043""},{""name"":""Weibo Hu"",""id"":""/profile/99659526475""},{""name"":""Zibin Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659502213""},{""name"":""Jie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99659477683""},{""name"":""Chuan Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659278791""},{""name"":""Fanghua Ye"",""id"":""/profile/99659201043""},{""name"":""Weibo Hu"",""id"":""/profile/99659526475""},{""name"":""Zibin Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659502213""}]","[""Sameer Agarwal, Kristin Branson, and Serge Belongie. 2006.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3389795,Using an Inverted Index Synopsis for Query Latency and Performance Prediction,"Predicting the query latency by a search engine has important benefits, for instance, in allowing the search engine to adjust its configuration to address long-running queries without unnecessarily sacrificing its effectiveness. However, for the dynamic pruning techniques that underlie many commercial search engines, achieving accurate predictions of query latencies is difficult. We propose the use of index synopses—which are stochastic samples of the full index—for attaining accurate timing predictions. Indeed, we experiment using the TREC ClueWeb09 collection, and a large set of real user queries, and find that using small index synopses it is possible to very accurately estimate properties of the larger index, including sizes of posting list unions and intersections. Thereafter, we demonstrate that index synopses facilitate two key use cases: first, for query efficiency prediction, we show that predicting the query latencies on the full index and classifying long-running queries can be accurately achieved using index synopses; second, for query performance prediction, we show that the effectiveness of queries can be estimated more accurately using a synopsis index post-retrieval predictor than a pre-retrieval predictor. Overall, our experiments demonstrate the value of such a stochastic sample of a larger index at predicting the properties of the larger index.","[{""name"":""Nicola Tonellotto"",""id"":""/profile/81100289293""},{""name"":""Craig Macdonald"",""id"":""/profile/81316489301""},{""name"":""Nicola Tonellotto"",""id"":""/profile/81100289293""},{""name"":""Craig Macdonald"",""id"":""/profile/81316489301""}]","[""Giambattista Amati, Claudio Carpineto, and Giovanni Romano. 2004.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3389547,Robust Unsupervised Cross-modal Hashing for Multimedia Retrieval,"With the quick development of social websites, there are more opportunities to have different media types (such as text, image, video, etc.) describing the same topic from large-scale heterogeneous data sources. To efficiently identify the inter-media correlations for multimedia retrieval, unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has gained increased interest due to the significant reduction in computation and storage. However, most UCMH methods assume that the data from different modalities are well paired. As a result, existing UCMH methods may not achieve satisfactory performance when partially paired data are given only. In this article, we propose a new-type of UCMH method called robust unsupervised cross-modal hashing (RUCMH). The major contribution lies in jointly learning modal-specific hash function, exploring the correlations among modalities with partial or even without any pairwise correspondence, and preserving the information of original features as much as possible. The learning process can be modeled via a joint minimization problem, and the corresponding optimization algorithm is presented. A series of experiments is conducted on four real-world datasets (Wiki, MIRFlickr, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO). The results demonstrate that RUCMH can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods, especially for the partially paired case, which validates the effectiveness of RUCMH.","[{""name"":""Miaomiao Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659088699""},{""name"":""Liping Jing"",""id"":""/profile/81344492532""},{""name"":""Michael K.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3394052,Dual-factor Generation Model for Conversation,"The conversation task is usually formulated as a conditional generation problem, i.e., to generate a natural and meaningful response given the input utterance. Generally speaking, this formulation is apparently based on an oversimplified assumption that the response is solely dependent on the input utterance. It ignores the subjective factor of the responder, e.g., his/her emotion or knowledge state, which is a major factor that affects the response in practice. Without explicitly differentiating such subjective factor behind the response, existing generation models can only learn the general shape of conversations, leading to the blandness problem of the response. Moreover, there is no intervention mechanism within the existing generation process, since the response is fully decided by the input utterance. In this work, we propose to view the conversation task as a dual-factor generation problem, including an objective factor denoting the input utterance and a subjective factor denoting the responder state. We extend the existing neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model to accommodate the responder state modeling. We introduce two types of responder state, i.e., discrete and continuous state, to model emotion state and topic preference state, respectively. We show that with our dual-factor generation model, we can not only better fit the conversation data, but also actively control the generation of the response with respect to sentiment or topic specificity.","[{""name"":""Ruqing Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659317267""},{""name"":""Jiafeng Guo"",""id"":""/profile/81363593975""},{""name"":""Yixing Fan"",""id"":""/profile/99659082712""},{""name"":""Yanyan Lan"",""id"":""/profile/81435599880""},{""name"":""Xueqi Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/81350598297""},{""name"":""Ruqing Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659317267""},{""name"":""Jiafeng Guo"",""id"":""/profile/81363593975""},{""name"":""Yixing Fan"",""id"":""/profile/99659082712""},{""name"":""Yanyan Lan"",""id"":""/profile/81435599880""},{""name"":""Xueqi Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/81350598297""}]","[""Rami Al-Rfou, Marc Pickett, Javier Snaider, Yun-hsuan Sung, Brian Strope, and Ray Kurzweil. 2016.
