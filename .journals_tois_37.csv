https://doi.org/10.1145/3231936,Binary Sketches for Secondary Filtering,"This article addresses the problem of matching the most similar data objects to a given query object. We adopt a generic model of similarity that involves the domain of objects and metric distance functions only. We examine the case of a large dataset in a complex data space, which makes this problem inherently difficult. Many indexing and searching approaches have been proposed, but they have often failed to efficiently prune complex search spaces and access large portions of the dataset when evaluating queries. We propose an approach to enhancing the existing search techniques to significantly reduce the number of accessed data objects while preserving the quality of the search results. In particular, we extend each data object with its sketch, a short binary string in Hamming space. These sketches approximate the similarity relationships in the original search space, and we use them to filter out non-relevant objects not pruned by the original search technique. We provide a probabilistic model to tune the parameters of the sketch-based filtering separately for each query object. Experiments conducted with different similarity search techniques and real-life datasets demonstrate that the secondary filtering can speed-up similarity search several times.","[{""name"":""Vladimir Mic"",""id"":""/profile/99659052846""},{""name"":""David Novak"",""id"":""/profile/81100506318""},{""name"":""Pavel Zezula"",""id"":""/profile/81100631454""},{""name"":""Vladimir Mic"",""id"":""/profile/99659052846""},{""name"":""David Novak"",""id"":""/profile/81100506318""},{""name"":""Pavel Zezula"",""id"":""/profile/81100631454""}]","[""Giuseppe Amato, Fausto Rabitti, Pasquale Savino, and Pavel Zezula. 2003.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3231934,Efficient Learning-Based Recommendation Algorithms for Top-N Tasks and Top-N Workers in Large-Scale Crowdsourcing Systems,"The task and worker recommendation problems in crowdsourcing systems have brought up unique characteristics that are not present in traditional recommendation scenarios, i.e., the huge flow of tasks with short lifespans, the importance of workers’ capabilities, and the quality of the completed tasks. These unique features make traditional recommendation approaches no longer satisfactory for task and worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. In this article, we propose a two-tier data representation scheme (defining a worker--category suitability score and a worker--task attractiveness score) to support personalized task and worker recommendations. We also extend two optimization methods, namely least mean square error and Bayesian personalized rank, to better fit the characteristics of task/worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. We then integrate the proposed representation scheme and the extended optimization methods along with the two adapted popular learning models, i.e., matrix factorization and kNN, and result in two lines of top-N recommendation algorithms for crowdsourcing systems: (1) Top-N-Tasks recommendation algorithms for discovering the top-N most suitable tasks for a given worker and (2) Top-N-Workers recommendation algorithms for identifying the top-N best workers for a task requester. An extensive experimental study is conducted that validates the effectiveness and efficiency of a broad spectrum of algorithms, accompanied by our analysis and the insights gained.","[{""name"":""Mejdl Safran"",""id"":""/profile/81503671692""},{""name"":""Dunren Che"",""id"":""/profile/81452599597""},{""name"":""Mejdl Safran"",""id"":""/profile/81503671692""},{""name"":""Dunren Che"",""id"":""/profile/81452599597""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3231937,Learning to Adaptively Rank Document Retrieval System Configurations,"Modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems have become more and more complex, involving a large number of parameters. For example, a system may choose from a set of possible retrieval models (BM25, language model, etc.), or various query expansion parameters, whose values greatly influence the overall retrieval effectiveness. Traditionally, these parameters are set at a system level based on training queries, and the same parameters are then used for different queries. We observe that it may not be easy to set all these parameters separately, since they can be dependent. In addition, a global setting for all queries may not best fit all individual queries with different characteristics. The parameters should be set according to these characteristics. In this article, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem by dealing with the entire system configurations (i.e., a set of parameters representing an IR system behaviour) instead of selecting a single parameter at a time. The selection of the best configuration is cast as a problem of ranking different possible configurations given a query. We apply learning-to-rank approaches for this task. We exploit both the query features and the system configuration features in the learning-to-rank method so that the selection of configuration is query dependent. The experiments we conducted on four TREC ad hoc collections show that this approach can significantly outperform the traditional method to tune system configuration globally (i.e., grid search) and leads to higher effectiveness than the top performing systems of the TREC tracks. We also perform an ablation analysis on the impact of different features on the model learning capability and show that query expansion features are among the most important for adaptive systems.","[{""name"":""Romain Deveaud"",""id"":""/profile/81488672931""},{""name"":""Josiane Mothe"",""id"":""/profile/81100339083""},{""name"":""Md Zia Ullah"",""id"":""/profile/99659281636""},{""name"":""Jian-Yun Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81100564379""},{""name"":""Romain Deveaud"",""id"":""/profile/81488672931""},{""name"":""Josiane Mothe"",""id"":""/profile/81100339083""},{""name"":""Md Zia Ullah"",""id"":""/profile/99659281636""},{""name"":""Jian-Yun Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81100564379""}]","[""Nega Alemayehu. 2003.

It is publicly available on GitHub and its data format was submitted as RFC 7932 in July 2016. Brotli is based on the Lempel-Ziv compression scheme and planned as a generic replacement of Gzip and ZLib. The main goal in its design was to compress data on the Internet, which meant optimizing the resources used at decoding time, while achieving maximal compression density.This article is intended to provide the first thorough, systematic description of the Brotli format as well as a detailed computational and experimental analysis of the main algorithmic blocks underlying the current encoder implementation, together with a comparison against compressors of different families constituting the state-of-the-art either in practice or in theory. This treatment will allow us to raise a set of new algorithmic and software engineering problems that deserve further attention from the scientific community.","[{""name"":""Jyrki Alakuijala"",""id"":""/profile/81502805144""},{""name"":""Andrea Farruggia"",""id"":""/profile/89758768357""},{""name"":""Paolo Ferragina"",""id"":""/profile/81100411624""},{""name"":""Eugene Kliuchnikov"",""id"":""/profile/99659332212""},{""name"":""Robert Obryk"",""id"":""/profile/99659332094""},{""name"":""Zoltan Szabadka"",""id"":""/profile/99659332553""},{""name"":""Lode Vandevenne"",""id"":""/profile/99659332178""},{""name"":""Jyrki Alakuijala"",""id"":""/profile/81502805144""},{""name"":""Andrea Farruggia"",""id"":""/profile/89758768357""},{""name"":""Paolo Ferragina"",""id"":""/profile/81100411624""},{""name"":""Eugene Kliuchnikov"",""id"":""/profile/99659332212""},{""name"":""Robert Obryk"",""id"":""/profile/99659332094""},{""name"":""Zoltan Szabadka"",""id"":""/profile/99659332553""},{""name"":""Lode Vandevenne"",""id"":""/profile/99659332178""}]","[""Jyrki Alakuijala and Zoltan Szabadka. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3233770,Product-Based Neural Networks for User Response Prediction over Multi-Field Categorical Data,"User response prediction is a crucial component for personalized information retrieval and filtering scenarios, such as recommender system and web search. The data in user response prediction is mostly in a multi-field categorical format and transformed into sparse representations via one-hot encoding. Due to the sparsity problems in representation and optimization, most research focuses on feature engineering and shallow modeling. Recently, deep neural networks have attracted research attention on such a problem for their high capacity and end-to-end training scheme. In this article, we study user response prediction in the scenario of click prediction. We first analyze a coupled gradient issue in latent vector-based models and propose kernel product to learn field-aware feature interactions. Then, we discuss an insensitive gradient issue in DNN-based models and propose Product-based Neural Network, which adopts a feature extractor to explore feature interactions. Generalizing the kernel product to a net-in-net architecture, we further propose Product-network in Network (PIN), which can generalize previous models. Extensive experiments on four industrial datasets and one contest dataset demonstrate that our models consistently outperform eight baselines on both area under curve and log loss. Besides, PIN makes great click-through rate improvement (relatively 34.67%) in online A/B test.","[{""name"":""Yanru Qu"",""id"":""/profile/99659319281""},{""name"":""Bohui Fang"",""id"":""/profile/99659319439""},{""name"":""Weinan Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81555923456""},{""name"":""Ruiming Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81488661679""},{""name"":""Minzhe Niu"",""id"":""/profile/99659319247""},{""name"":""Huifeng Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99659154282""},{""name"":""Yong Yu"",""id"":""/profile/81548005779""},{""name"":""Xiuqiang He"",""id"":""/profile/81331494271""},{""name"":""Yanru Qu"",""id"":""/profile/99659319281""},{""name"":""Bohui Fang"",""id"":""/profile/99659319439""},{""name"":""Weinan Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81555923456""},{""name"":""Ruiming Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81488661679""},{""name"":""Minzhe Niu"",""id"":""/profile/99659319247""},{""name"":""Huifeng Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99659154282""},{""name"":""Yong Yu"",""id"":""/profile/81548005779""},{""name"":""Xiuqiang He"",""id"":""/profile/81331494271""}]","[""Deepak Agarwal, Rahul Agrawal, Rajiv Khanna, and Nagaraj Kota. 2010.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3233771,From Question to Text: Question-Oriented Feature Attention for Answer Selection,"Understanding unstructured texts is an essential skill for human beings as it enables knowledge acquisition. Although understanding unstructured texts is easy for we human beings with good education, it is a great challenge for machines. Recently, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques, researchers put efforts to teach machines to understand texts and justify the educated machines by letting them solve the questions upon the given unstructured texts, inspired by the reading comprehension test as we humans do. However, feature effectiveness with respect to different questions significantly hinders the performance of answer selection, because different questions may focus on various aspects of the given text and answer candidates. To solve this problem, we propose a question-oriented feature attention (QFA) mechanism, which learns to weight different engineering features according to the given question, so that important features with respect to the specific question is emphasized accordingly. Experiments on MCTest dataset have well-validated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, the proposed QFA is applicable to various IR tasks, such as question answering and answer selection. We have verified the applicability on a crawled community-based question-answering dataset.","[{""name"":""Heyan Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81365594349""},{""name"":""Xiaochi Wei"",""id"":""/profile/83458651357""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Xianling Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99658666924""},{""name"":""Xin-Shun Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81458654506""},{""name"":""Heyan Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81365594349""},{""name"":""Xiaochi Wei"",""id"":""/profile/83458651357""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Xianling Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99658666924""},{""name"":""Xin-Shun Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81458654506""}]","[""Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3233773,A Deep Bayesian Tensor-Based System for Video Recommendation,"With the availability of abundant online multi-relational video information, recommender systems that can effectively exploit these sorts of data and suggest creatively interesting items will become increasingly important. Recent research illustrates that tensor models offer effective approaches for complex multi-relational data learning and missing element completion. So far, most tensor-based user clustering models have focused on the accuracy of recommendation. Given the dynamic nature of online media, recommendation in this setting is more challenging as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings as well as to identify unseen items as candidates of recommendation. Targeting at constructing a recommender system that can encourage more creativity, a deep Bayesian probabilistic tensor framework for tag and item recommendation is proposed. During the score ranking processes, a metric called Bayesian surprise is incorporated to increase the creativity of the recommended candidates. The new algorithm, called Deep Canonical PARAFAC Factorization (DCPF), is evaluated on both synthetic and large-scale real-world problems. An empirical study for video recommendation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model and indicates that it can better capture the latent patterns of interactions and generates interesting recommendations based on creative tag combinations.","[{""name"":""Wei Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81323493070""},{""name"":""Fu-Lai Chung"",""id"":""/profile/81351592351""},{""name"":""Wenhao Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/81551175256""},{""name"":""Martin Ester"",""id"":""/profile/81100382875""},{""name"":""Wei Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81375601156""},{""name"":""Wei Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81323493070""},{""name"":""Fu-Lai Chung"",""id"":""/profile/81351592351""},{""name"":""Wenhao Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/81551175256""},{""name"":""Martin Ester"",""id"":""/profile/81100382875""},{""name"":""Wei Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81375601156""}]","[""Panagiotis Adamopoulos and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3233772,Shallow and Deep Syntactic/Semantic Structures for Passage Reranking in Question-Answering Systems,"In this article, we extensively study the use of syntactic and semantic structures obtained with shallow and full syntactic parsers for answer passage reranking. We propose several dependency and constituent-based structures, also enriched with Linked Open Data (LD) knowledge to represent pairs of questions and answer passages. We encode such tree structures in learning-to-rank (L2R) algorithms using tree kernels, which can project them in tree substructure spaces, where each dimension represents a powerful syntactic/semantic feature. Additionally, since we define links between question and passage structures, our tree kernel spaces also include relational structural features. We carried out an extensive comparative experimentation of our models for automatic answer selection benchmarks on different TREC QA corpora as well as the newer Wikipedia-based dataset, namely WikiQA, which has been widely used to test sentence rerankers. The results consistently demonstrate that our structural semantic models achieve the state of the art in passage reranking. In particular, we derived the following important findings: (i) relational syntactic structures are essential to achieve superior results; (ii) models trained with dependency trees can outperform those trained with shallow trees, e.g., in case of sentence reranking; (iii) external knowledge automatically generated with focus and question classifiers is very effective; and (iv) the semantic information derived by LD and incorporated in syntactic structures can be used to replace the knowledge provided by the above-mentioned classifiers. This is a remarkable advantage as it enables our models to increase coverage and portability over new domains.","[{""name"":""Kateryna Tymoshenko"",""id"":""/profile/81470654252""},{""name"":""Alessandro Moschitti"",""id"":""/profile/81100511871""},{""name"":""Kateryna Tymoshenko"",""id"":""/profile/81470654252""},{""name"":""Alessandro Moschitti"",""id"":""/profile/81100511871""}]","[""Azad Abad and Alessandro Moschitti. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3238250,Seed-Guided Topic Model for Document Filtering and Classification,"One important necessity is to filter out the irrelevant information and organize the relevant information into meaningful categories. However, developing text classifiers often requires a large number of labeled documents as training examples. Manually labeling documents is costly and time-consuming. More importantly, it becomes unrealistic to know all the categories covered by the documents beforehand. Recently, a few methods have been proposed to label documents by using a small set of relevant keywords for each category, known as dataless text classification. In this article, we propose a seed-guided topic model for the dataless text filtering and classification (named DFC). Given a collection of unlabeled documents, and for each specified category a small set of seed words that are relevant to the semantic meaning of the category, DFC filters out the irrelevant documents and classifies the relevant documents into the corresponding categories through topic influence. DFC models two kinds of topics: category-topics and general-topics. Also, there are two kinds of category-topics: relevant-topics and irrelevant-topics. Each relevant-topic is associated with one specific category, representing its semantic meaning. The irrelevant-topics represent the semantics of the unknown categories covered by the document collection. And the general-topics capture the global semantic information. DFC assumes that each document is associated with a single category-topic and a mixture of general-topics. A novelty of the model is that DFC learns the topics by exploiting the explicit word co-occurrence patterns between the seed words and regular words (i.e., non-seed words) in the document collection. A document is then filtered, or classified, based on its posterior category-topic assignment. Experiments on two widely used datasets show that DFC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art dataless text classifiers for both classification with filtering and classification without filtering. In many tasks, DFC can also achieve comparable or even better classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art supervised learning solutions. Our experimental results further show that DFC is insensitive to the tuning parameters. Moreover, we conduct a thorough study about the impact of seed words for existing dataless text classification techniques. The results reveal that it is not using more seed words but the document coverage of the seed words for the corresponding category that affects the dataless classification performance.","[{""name"":""Chenliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658620810""},{""name"":""Shiqian Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659331827""},{""name"":""Jian Xing"",""id"":""/profile/99659082206""},{""name"":""Aixin Sun"",""id"":""/profile/81100446994""},{""name"":""Zongyang Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81508684706""},{""name"":""Chenliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658620810""},{""name"":""Shiqian Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659331827""},{""name"":""Jian Xing"",""id"":""/profile/99659082206""},{""name"":""Aixin Sun"",""id"":""/profile/81100446994""},{""name"":""Zongyang Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81508684706""}]","[""David Andrzejewski, Xiaojin Zhu, and Mark Craven. 2009.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3243652,Transfer to Rank for Heterogeneous One-Class Collaborative Filtering,"Heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering is an emerging and important problem in recommender systems, where two different types of one-class feedback, i.e., purchases and browses, are available as input data. The associated challenges include ambiguity of browses, scarcity of purchases, and heterogeneity arising from different feedback. In this article, we propose to model purchases and browses from a new perspective, i.e., users’ roles of mixer, browser and purchaser. Specifically, we design a novel transfer learning solution termed role-based transfer to rank (RoToR), which contains two variants, i.e., integrative RoToR and sequential RoToR. In integrative RoToR, we leverage browses into the preference learning task of purchases, in which we take each user as a sophisticated customer (i.e., mixer) that is able to take different types of feedback into consideration. In sequential RoToR, we aim to simplify the integrative one by decomposing it into two dependent phases according to a typical shopping process. Furthermore, we instantiate both variants using different preference learning paradigms such as pointwise preference learning and pairwise preference learning. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical studies with various baseline methods on three large public datasets and find that our RoToR can perform significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods.","[{""name"":""Weike Pan"",""id"":""/profile/99658657571""},{""name"":""Qiang Yang"",""id"":""/profile/81548761456""},{""name"":""Wanling Cai"",""id"":""/profile/99659342993""},{""name"":""Yaofeng Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659139391""},{""name"":""Qing Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659342961""},{""name"":""Xiaogang Peng"",""id"":""/profile/99658963380""},{""name"":""Zhong Ming"",""id"":""/profile/81100136462""},{""name"":""Weike Pan"",""id"":""/profile/99658657571""},{""name"":""Qiang Yang"",""id"":""/profile/81548761456""},{""name"":""Wanling Cai"",""id"":""/profile/99659342993""},{""name"":""Yaofeng Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659139391""},{""name"":""Qing Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659342961""},{""name"":""Xiaogang Peng"",""id"":""/profile/99658963380""},{""name"":""Zhong Ming"",""id"":""/profile/81100136462""}]","[""Xiao Bai, Ioannis Arapakis, Berkant Barla Cambazoglu, and Ana Freire. 2017.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3268928,Jointly Minimizing the Expected Costs of Review for Responsiveness and Privilege in E-Discovery,"Discovery is an important aspect of the civil litigation process in the United States of America, in which all parties to a lawsuit are permitted to request relevant evidence from other parties. With the rapid growth of digital content, the emerging need for “e-discovery” has created a strong demand for techniques that can be used to review massive collections both for “responsiveness” (i.e., relevance) to the request and for “privilege” (i.e., presence of legally protected content that the party performing the review may have a right to withhold). In this process, the party performing the review may incur costs of two types, namely, annotation costs (deriving from the fact that human reviewers need to be paid for their work) and misclassification costs (deriving from the fact that failing to correctly determine the responsiveness or privilege of a document may adversely affect the interests of the parties in various ways). Relying exclusively on automatic classification would minimize annotation costs but could result in substantial misclassification costs, while relying exclusively on manual classification could generate the opposite consequences. This article proposes a risk minimization framework (called MINECORE, for “<underline>min</underline>imizing the <underline>e</underline>xpected <underline>co</underline>sts of <underline>re</underline>view”) that seeks to strike an optimal balance between these two extreme stands. In MINECORE (a) the documents are first automatically classified for both responsiveness and privilege, and then (b) some of the automatically classified documents are annotated by human reviewers for responsiveness (typically by junior reviewers) and/or, in cascade, for privilege (typically by senior reviewers), with the overall goal of minimizing the expected cost (i.e., the risk) of the entire process. Risk minimization is achieved by optimizing, for both responsiveness and privilege, the choice of which documents to manually review. We present a simulation study in which classes from a standard text classification test collection (RCV1-v2) are used as surrogates for responsiveness and privilege. The results indicate that MINECORE can yield substantially lower total cost than any of a set of strong baselines.","[{""name"":""Douglas W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3281659,Adversarial Distillation for Efficient Recommendation with External Knowledge,"Integrating external knowledge into the recommendation system has attracted increasing attention in both industry and academic communities. Recent methods mostly take the power of neural network for effective knowledge representation to improve the recommendation performance. However, the heavy deep architectures in existing models are usually incorporated in an embedded manner, which may greatly increase the model complexity and lower the runtime efficiency.To simultaneously take the power of deep learning for external knowledge modeling as well as maintaining the model efficiency at test time, we reformulate the problem of recommendation with external knowledge into a generalized distillation framework. The general idea is to free the complex deep architecture into a separate model, which is only used in the training phrase, while abandoned at test time. In particular, in the training phrase, the external knowledge is processed by a comprehensive teacher model to produce valuable information to teach a simple and efficient student model. Once the framework is learned, the teacher model is abandoned, and only the succinct yet enhanced student model is used to make fast predictions at test time. In this article, we specify the external knowledge as user review, and to leverage it in an effective manner, we further extend the traditional generalized distillation framework by designing a Selective Distillation Network (SDNet) with adversarial adaption and orthogonality constraint strategies to make it more robust to noise information.Extensive experiments verify that our model can not only improve the performance of rating prediction, but also can significantly reduce time consumption when making predictions as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.","[{""name"":""Xu Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659000242""},{""name"":""Yongfeng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659562138""},{""name"":""Hongteng Xu"",""id"":""/profile/99658745674""},{""name"":""Zheng Qin"",""id"":""/profile/81310499840""},{""name"":""Hongyuan Zha"",""id"":""/profile/81490670693""},{""name"":""Xu Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659000242""},{""name"":""Yongfeng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659562138""},{""name"":""Hongteng Xu"",""id"":""/profile/99658745674""},{""name"":""Zheng Qin"",""id"":""/profile/81310499840""},{""name"":""Hongyuan Zha"",""id"":""/profile/81490670693""}]","[""David M.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3284102,SMAPH: A Piggyback Approach for Entity-Linking in Web Queries,"We study the problem of linking the terms of a web-search query to a semantic representation given by the set of entities (a.k.a. concepts) mentioned in it. We introduce SMAPH, a system that performs this task using the information coming from a web search engine, an approach we call “piggybacking.” We employ search engines to alleviate the noise and irregularities that characterize the language of queries. Snippets returned as search results also provide a context for the query that makes it easier to disambiguate the meaning of the query. From the search results, SMAPH builds a set of candidate entities with high coverage. This set is filtered by linking back the candidate entities to the terms occurring in the input query, ensuring high precision. A greedy disambiguation algorithm performs this filtering; it maximizes the coherence of the solution by iteratively discovering the pertinent entities mentioned in the query. We propose three versions of SMAPH that outperform state-of-the-art solutions on the known benchmarks and on the GERDAQ dataset, a novel dataset that we have built specifically for this problem via crowd-sourcing and that we make publicly available.","[{""name"":""Marco Cornolti"",""id"":""/profile/81464672411""},{""name"":""Paolo Ferragina"",""id"":""/profile/81100411624""},{""name"":""Massimiliano Ciaramita"",""id"":""/profile/81309494986""},{""name"":""Stefan Rüd"",""id"":""/profile/81486654401""},{""name"":""Hinrich Schütze"",""id"":""/profile/81100395933""},{""name"":""Marco Cornolti"",""id"":""/profile/81464672411""},{""name"":""Paolo Ferragina"",""id"":""/profile/81100411624""},{""name"":""Massimiliano Ciaramita"",""id"":""/profile/81309494986""},{""name"":""Stefan Rüd"",""id"":""/profile/81486654401""},{""name"":""Hinrich Schütze"",""id"":""/profile/81100395933""}]","[""Areej Alasiry, Mark Levene, and Alexandra Poulovassilis. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3284101,Understanding Faceted Search from Data Science and Human Factor Perspectives,"Faceted search has become a common feature on most search interfaces in e-commerce websites, digital libraries, government’s open information portals, and so on. Beyond the existing studies on developing algorithms for faceted search and empirical studies on facet usage, this study investigated user real-time interactions with facets over the course of a search from both data science and human factor perspectives. It adopted a Random Forest (RF) model to successfully predict facet use using search dynamic variables. In addition, the RF model provided a ranking of variables by their predictive power, which suggests that the search process follows rhythmic flow of a sequence within which facet addition is mostly influenced by its immediately preceding action. In the follow-up user study, we found that participants used facets at critical points from the beginning to end of search sessions. Participants used facets for distinctive reasons at different stages. They also used facets implicitly without applying the facets to their search. Most participants liked the faceted search, although a few participants were concerned about the choice overload introduced by facets. The results of this research can be used to understand information seekers and propose or refine a set of practical design guidelines for faceted search.","[{""name"":""Xi Niu"",""id"":""/profile/99659186847""},{""name"":""Xiangyu Fan"",""id"":""/profile/81496640517""},{""name"":""Tao Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659343300""},{""name"":""Xi Niu"",""id"":""/profile/99659186847""},{""name"":""Xiangyu Fan"",""id"":""/profile/81496640517""},{""name"":""Tao Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659343300""}]","[""Kristin Antelman, Emily Lynema, and Andrew K.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3291756,Top-N Recommendation with Multi-Channel Positive Feedback using Factorization Machines,"User interactions can be considered to constitute different feedback channels, for example, view, click, like or follow, that provide implicit information on users’ preferences. Each implicit feedback channel typically carries a unary, positive-only signal that can be exploited by collaborative filtering models to generate lists of personalized recommendations. This article investigates how a learning-to-rank recommender system can best take advantage of implicit feedback signals from multiple channels. We focus on Factorization Machines (FMs) with Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), a pairwise learning-to-rank method, that allows us to experiment with different forms of exploitation. We perform extensive experiments on three datasets with multiple types of feedback to arrive at a series of insights. We compare conventional, direct integration of feedback types with our proposed method, which exploits multiple feedback channels during the sampling process of training. We refer to our method as multi-channel sampling. Our results show that multi-channel sampling outperforms conventional integration, and that sampling with the relative “level” of feedback is always superior to a level-blind sampling approach. We evaluate our method experimentally on three datasets in different domains and observe that with our multi-channel sampler the accuracy of recommendations can be improved considerably compared to the state-of-the-art models. Further experiments reveal that the appropriate sampling method depends on particular properties of datasets such as popularity skewness.","[{""name"":""Babak Loni"",""id"":""/profile/81488672021""},{""name"":""Roberto Pagano"",""id"":""/profile/81759002157""},{""name"":""Martha Larson"",""id"":""/profile/81363601281""},{""name"":""Alan Hanjalic"",""id"":""/profile/81502652686""},{""name"":""Babak Loni"",""id"":""/profile/81488672021""},{""name"":""Roberto Pagano"",""id"":""/profile/81759002157""},{""name"":""Martha Larson"",""id"":""/profile/81363601281""},{""name"":""Alan Hanjalic"",""id"":""/profile/81502652686""}]","[""Arthur F. da Costa and Marcelo G.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3291060,MMALFM: Explainable Recommendation by Leveraging Reviews and Images,"Personalized rating prediction is an important research problem in recommender systems. Although the latent factor model (e.g., matrix factorization) achieves good accuracy in rating prediction, it suffers from many problems including cold-start, non-transparency, and suboptimal results for individual user-item pairs. In this article, we exploit textual reviews and item images together with ratings to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we first apply a proposed multi-modal aspect-aware topic model (MATM) on text reviews and item images to model users’ preferences and items’ features from different aspects, and also estimate the aspect importance of a user toward an item. Then, the aspect importance is integrated into a novel aspect-aware latent factor model (ALFM), which learns user’s and item’s latent factors based on ratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weight matrix to associate those latent factors with the same set of aspects in MATM, such that the latent factors could be used to estimate aspect ratings. Finally, the overall rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings, which are weighted by the corresponding aspect importance. To this end, our model could alleviate the data sparsity problem and gain good interpretability for recommendation. Besides, every aspect rating is weighted by its aspect importance, which is dependent on the targeted user’s preferences and the targeted item’s features. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method can model a user’s preferences on an item more accurately for each user-item pair. Comprehensive experimental studies have been conducted on the Yelp 2017 Challenge dataset and Amazon product datasets. Results show that (1) our method achieves significant improvement compared to strong baseline methods, especially for users with only few ratings; (2) item visual features can improve the prediction performance—the effects of item image features on improving the prediction results depend on the importance of the visual features for the items; and (3) our model can explicitly interpret the predicted results in great detail.","[{""name"":""Zhiyong Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/87958925057""},{""name"":""Xiaojun Chang"",""id"":""/profile/99658727663""},{""name"":""Lei Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81490669513""},{""name"":""Rose C.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3291059,Fine-grained Geolocation of Tweets in Temporal Proximity,"In fine-grained tweet geolocation, tweets are linked to the specific venues (e.g., restaurants, shops) from which they were posted. This explicitly recovers the venue context that is essential for applications such as location-based advertising or user profiling. For this geolocation task, we focus on geolocating tweets that are contained in tweet sequences. In a tweet sequence, tweets are posted from some latent venue(s) by the same user and within a short time interval. This scenario arises from two observations: (1) It is quite common that users post multiple tweets in a short time and (2) most tweets are not geocoded. To more accurately geolocate a tweet, we propose a model that performs query expansion on the tweet (query) using two novel approaches. The first approach temporal query expansion considers users’ staying behavior around venues. The second approach visitation query expansion leverages on user revisiting the same or similar venues in the past. We combine both query expansion approaches via a novel fusion framework and overlay them on a Hidden Markov Model to account for sequential information. In our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and metrics, we show our proposed model to be more robust and accurate than other baselines.","[{""name"":""Wen-Haw Chong"",""id"":""/profile/99658741217""},{""name"":""Ee-Peng Lim"",""id"":""/profile/82258898657""},{""name"":""Wen-Haw Chong"",""id"":""/profile/99658741217""},{""name"":""Ee-Peng Lim"",""id"":""/profile/82258898657""}]","[""Amr Ahmed, Liangjie Hong, and Alexander J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3295499,Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Translation-Based POI Recommendation,"The increasing proliferation of location-based social networks brings about a huge volume of user check-in data, which facilitates the recommendation of points of interest (POIs). Time and location are the two most important contextual factors in the user’s decision-making for choosing a POI to visit. In this article, we focus on the spatiotemporal context-aware POI recommendation, which considers the joint effect of time and location for POI recommendation. Inspired by the recent advances in knowledge graph embedding, we propose a spatiotemporal context-aware and translation-based recommender framework (STA) to model the third-order relationship among users, POIs, and spatiotemporal contexts for large-scale POI recommendation. Specifically, we embed both users and POIs into a “transition space” where spatiotemporal contexts (i.e., a <time, location> pair) are modeled as translation vectors operating on users and POIs. We further develop a series of strategies to exploit various correlation information to address the data sparsity and cold-start issues for new spatiotemporal contexts, new users, and new POIs. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our STA framework achieves the superior performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data sparsity, and effectiveness in handling the cold-start problem.","[{""name"":""Tieyun Qian"",""id"":""/profile/81335496450""},{""name"":""Bei Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659345291""},{""name"":""Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen"",""id"":""/profile/99659125299""},{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""},{""name"":""Tieyun Qian"",""id"":""/profile/81335496450""},{""name"":""Bei Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659345291""},{""name"":""Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen"",""id"":""/profile/99659125299""},{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius, Bamshad Mobasher, Francesco Ricci, and Alex Tuzhilin. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3295822,Attentive Long Short-Term Preference Modeling for Personalized Product Search,"E-commerce users may expect different products even for the same query, due to their diverse personal preferences. It is well known that there are two types of preferences: long-term ones and short-term ones. The former refers to users’ inherent purchasing bias and evolves slowly. By contrast, the latter reflects users’ purchasing inclination in a relatively short period. They both affect users’ current purchasing intentions. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to jointly model them for the personalized product search. To this end, we propose a novel Attentive Long Short-Term Preference model, dubbed as ALSTP, for personalized product search. Our model adopts the neural networks approach to learn and integrate the long- and short-term user preferences with the current query for the personalized product search. In particular, two attention networks are designed to distinguish which factors in the short-term as well as long-term user preferences are more relevant to the current query. This unique design enables our model to capture users’ current search intentions more accurately. Our work is the first to apply attention mechanisms to integrate both long- and short-term user preferences with the given query for the personalized search. Extensive experiments over four Amazon product datasets show that our model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art product search methods in terms of different evaluation metrics.","[{""name"":""Yangyang Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99659315648""},{""name"":""Zhiyong Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/87958925057""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Yinglong Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659245168""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Mohan Kankanhalli"",""id"":""/profile/81100562305""},{""name"":""Yangyang Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99659315648""},{""name"":""Zhiyong Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/87958925057""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Yinglong Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659245168""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Mohan Kankanhalli"",""id"":""/profile/81100562305""}]","[""Qingyao Ai, Yongfeng Zhang, Keping Bi, Xu Chen, and W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3295823,Gaussian Processes for Rumour Stance Classification in Social Media,"Social media tend to be rife with rumours while new reports are released piecemeal during breaking news. Interestingly, one can mine multiple reactions expressed by social media users in those situations, exploring their stance towards rumours, ultimately enabling the flagging of highly disputed rumours as being potentially false. In this work, we set out to develop an automated, supervised classifier that uses multi-task learning to classify the stance expressed in each individual tweet in a conversation around a rumour as either supporting, denying or questioning the rumour. Using a Gaussian Process classifier, and exploring its effectiveness on two datasets with very different characteristics and varying distributions of stances, we show that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baseline classifiers. Our classifier is especially effective in estimating the distribution of different types of stance associated with a given rumour, which we set forth as a desired characteristic for a rumour-tracking system that will show both ordinary users of Twitter and professional news practitioners how others orient to the disputed veracity of a rumour, with the final aim of establishing its actual truth value.","[{""name"":""Michal Lukasik"",""id"":""/profile/81502806421""},{""name"":""Kalina Bontcheva"",""id"":""/profile/81100458673""},{""name"":""Trevor Cohn"",""id"":""/profile/81323489303""},{""name"":""Arkaitz Zubiaga"",""id"":""/profile/81442605826""},{""name"":""Maria Liakata"",""id"":""/profile/81100593437""},{""name"":""Rob Procter"",""id"":""/profile/81100608758""},{""name"":""Michal Lukasik"",""id"":""/profile/81502806421""},{""name"":""Kalina Bontcheva"",""id"":""/profile/81100458673""},{""name"":""Trevor Cohn"",""id"":""/profile/81323489303""},{""name"":""Arkaitz Zubiaga"",""id"":""/profile/81442605826""},{""name"":""Maria Liakata"",""id"":""/profile/81100593437""},{""name"":""Rob Procter"",""id"":""/profile/81100608758""}]","[""Apoorv Agarwal, Boyi Xie, Ilia Vovsha, Owen Rambow, and Rebecca Passonneau. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3298987,ELSA: A Multilingual Document Summarization Algorithm Based on Frequent Itemsets and Latent Semantic Analysis,"Sentence-based summarization aims at extracting concise summaries of collections of textual documents. Summaries consist of a worthwhile subset of document sentences. The most effective multilingual strategies rely on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and on frequent itemset mining, respectively. LSA-based summarizers pick the document sentences that cover the most important concepts. Concepts are modeled as combinations of single-document terms and are derived from a term-by-sentence matrix by exploiting Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Itemset-based summarizers pick the sentences that contain the largest number of frequent itemsets, which represent combinations of frequently co-occurring terms. The main drawbacks of existing approaches are (i) the inability of LSA to consider the correlation between combinations of multiple-document terms and the underlying concepts, (ii) the inherent redundancy of frequent itemsets because similar itemsets may be related to the same concept, and (iii) the inability of itemset-based summarizers to correlate itemsets with the underlying document concepts. To overcome the issues of both of the abovementioned algorithms, we propose a new summarization approach that exploits frequent itemsets to describe all of the latent concepts covered by the documents under analysis and LSA to reduce the potentially redundant set of itemsets to a compact set of uncorrelated concepts. The summarizer selects the sentences that cover the latent concepts with minimal redundancy. We tested the summarization algorithm on both multilingual and English-language benchmark document collections. The proposed approach performed significantly better than both itemset- and LSA-based summarizers, and better than most of the other state-of-the-art approaches.","[{""name"":""Luca Cagliero"",""id"":""/profile/81453655181""},{""name"":""Paolo Garza"",""id"":""/profile/81100349712""},{""name"":""Elena Baralis"",""id"":""/profile/81100468804""},{""name"":""Luca Cagliero"",""id"":""/profile/81453655181""},{""name"":""Paolo Garza"",""id"":""/profile/81100349712""},{""name"":""Elena Baralis"",""id"":""/profile/81100468804""}]","[""R.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3298988,A Context-Aware User-Item Representation Learning for Item Recommendation,"Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode user preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is incapable of fully capturing users’ preferences, because users usually exhibit different preferences when interacting with different items. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data, respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In the review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the pair-based relevant features for the given user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only reivew-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, an interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on seven real-world datasets show that CARL achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with the attention mechanism, we show that the pair-based relevant information (i.e., context-aware information) in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction for different user-item pairs.","[{""name"":""Libing Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81319504268""},{""name"":""Cong Quan"",""id"":""/profile/99659318329""},{""name"":""Chenliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658620810""},{""name"":""Qian Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81387600788""},{""name"":""Bolong Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99658656653""},{""name"":""Xiangyang Luo"",""id"":""/profile/81309499573""},{""name"":""Libing Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81319504268""},{""name"":""Cong Quan"",""id"":""/profile/99659318329""},{""name"":""Chenliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658620810""},{""name"":""Qian Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81387600788""},{""name"":""Bolong Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99658656653""},{""name"":""Xiangyang Luo"",""id"":""/profile/81309499573""}]","[""Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3300197,A Multi-View–Based Collective Entity Linking Method,"Facing lots of name mentions appearing on the web, entity linking is essential for many information processing applications. To improve linking accuracy, the relations between entities are usually considered in the linking process. This kind of method is called collective entity linking and can obtain high-quality results. There are two kinds of information helpful to reveal the relations between entities, i.e., contextual information and structural information of entities. Most traditional collective entity linking methods consider them separately. In fact, these two kinds of information represent entities from specific and diverse views and can enhance each other, respectively. Besides, if we look into each view closely, it can be separated into sub-views that are more meaningful. For this reason, this article proposes a multi-view–based collective entity linking algorithm, which combines several views of entities into an objective function for entity linking. The importance of each view can be valued and the linking results can be obtained along with resolving this objective function. Experimental results demonstrate that our linking algorithm can acquire higher accuracy than many state-of-the-art entity linking methods. Besides, since we simplify the entity's structure and change the entity linking to a sub-matrix searching problem, our algorithm also obtains high efficiency.","[{""name"":""Ming Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81484642561""},{""name"":""Gu Gong"",""id"":""/profile/99659346539""},{""name"":""Bing Qin"",""id"":""/profile/81547500756""},{""name"":""Ting Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81332513140""},{""name"":""Ming Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81484642561""},{""name"":""Gu Gong"",""id"":""/profile/99659346539""},{""name"":""Bing Qin"",""id"":""/profile/81547500756""},{""name"":""Ting Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81332513140""}]","[""O.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3300196,Risk-Sensitive Learning to Rank with Evolutionary Multi-Objective Feature Selection,"Learning to Rank (L2R) is one of the main research lines in Information Retrieval. Risk-sensitive L2R is a sub-area of L2R that tries to learn models that are good on average while at the same time reducing the risk of performing poorly in a few but important queries (e.g., medical or legal queries). One way of reducing risk in learned models is by selecting and removing noisy, redundant features, or features that promote some queries to the detriment of others. This is exacerbated by learning methods that usually maximize an average metric (e.g., mean average precision (MAP) or Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)). However, historically, feature selection (FS) methods have focused only on effectiveness and feature reduction as the main objectives. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to evaluate FS for L2R with an additional objective in mind, namely risk-sensitiveness. We present novel single and multi-objective criteria to optimize feature reduction, effectiveness, and risk-sensitiveness, all at the same time. We also introduce a new methodology to explore the search space, suggesting effective and efficient extensions of a well-known Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) for FS applied to L2R. Our experiments show that explicitly including risk as an objective criterion is crucial to achieving a more effective and risk-sensitive performance. We also provide a thorough analysis of our methodology and experimental results.","[{""name"":""Daniel Xavier Sousa"",""id"":""/profile/81413595180""},{""name"":""Sérgio Canuto"",""id"":""/profile/99658655371""},{""name"":""Marcos André Gonçalves"",""id"":""/profile/81325488266""},{""name"":""Thierson Couto Rosa"",""id"":""/profile/81551564656""},{""name"":""Wellington Santos Martins"",""id"":""/profile/81552736956""},{""name"":""Daniel Xavier Sousa"",""id"":""/profile/81413595180""},{""name"":""Sérgio Canuto"",""id"":""/profile/99658655371""},{""name"":""Marcos André Gonçalves"",""id"":""/profile/81325488266""},{""name"":""Thierson Couto Rosa"",""id"":""/profile/81551564656""},{""name"":""Wellington Santos Martins"",""id"":""/profile/81552736956""}]","[""S.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3302913,Handling Massive N-Gram Datasets Efficiently,"Two fundamental problems concern the handling of large n-gram language models: indexing, that is, compressing the n-grams and associated satellite values without compromising their retrieval speed, and estimation, that is, computing the probability distribution of the n-grams extracted from a large textual source.Performing these two tasks efficiently is vital for several applications in the fields of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, such as auto-completion in search engines and machine translation.Regarding the problem of indexing, we describe compressed, exact, and lossless data structures that simultaneously achieve high space reductions and no time degradation with respect to the state-of-the-art solutions and related software packages. In particular, we present a compressed trie data structure in which each word of an n-gram following a context of fixed length k, that is, its preceding k words, is encoded as an integer whose value is proportional to the number of words that follow such context. Since the number of words following a given context is typically very small in natural languages, we lower the space of representation to compression levels that were never achieved before, allowing the indexing of billions of strings. Despite the significant savings in space, our technique introduces a negligible penalty at query time.Specifically, the most space-efficient competitors in the literature, which are both quantized and lossy, do not take less than our trie data structure and are up to 5 times slower. Conversely, our trie is as fast as the fastest competitor but also retains an advantage of up to 65% in absolute space.Regarding the problem of estimation, we present a novel algorithm for estimating modified Kneser-Ney language models that have emerged as the de-facto choice for language modeling in both academia and industry thanks to their relatively low perplexity performance. Estimating such models from large textual sources poses the challenge of devising algorithms that make a parsimonious use of the disk.The state-of-the-art algorithm uses three sorting steps in external memory: we show an improved construction that requires only one sorting step by exploiting the properties of the extracted n-gram strings. With an extensive experimental analysis performed on billions of n-grams, we show an average improvement of 4.5 times on the total runtime of the previous approach.","[{""name"":""Giulio Ermanno Pibiri"",""id"":""/profile/99659151720""},{""name"":""Rossano Venturini"",""id"":""/profile/81327492057""},{""name"":""Giulio Ermanno Pibiri"",""id"":""/profile/99659151720""},{""name"":""Rossano Venturini"",""id"":""/profile/81327492057""}]","[""2006.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3309543,Learning from Multi-annotator Data: A Noise-aware Classification Framework,"In the field of sentiment analysis and emotion detection in social media, or other tasks such as text classification involving supervised learning, researchers rely more heavily on large and accurate labelled training datasets. However, obtaining large-scale labelled datasets is time-consuming and high-quality labelled datasets are expensive and scarce. To deal with these problems, online crowdsourcing systems provide us an efficient way to accelerate the process of collecting training data via distributing the enormous tasks to various annotators to help create large amounts of labelled data at an affordable cost. Nowadays, these crowdsourcing platforms are heavily needed in dealing with social media text, since the social network platforms (e.g., Twitter) generate huge amounts of data in textual form everyday. However, people from different social and knowledge backgrounds have different views on various texts, which may lead to noisy labels. The existing noisy label aggregation/refinement algorithms mostly focus on aggregating labels from noisy annotations, which would not guarantee their effectiveness on the subsequent classification/ranking tasks. In this article, we propose a noise-aware classification framework that integrates the steps of noisy label aggregation and classification. The aggregated noisy crowd labels are fed into a classifier for training, while the predicted labels are employed as feedback for adjusting the parameters at the label aggregating stage. The classification framework is suitable for directly running on crowdsourcing datasets and applies to various kinds of classification algorithms. The feedback strategy makes it possible for us to find optimal parameters instead of using known data for parameter selection. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our method provide significant label aggregation performance for both binary and multiple classification tasks under various noisy environments. Experimenting on real-world data validates the feasibility of our framework in real noise data and helps us verify the reasonableness of the simulated experiment settings.","[{""name"":""Xueying Zhan"",""id"":""/profile/99659079260""},{""name"":""Yaowei Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659352308""},{""name"":""Yanghui Rao"",""id"":""/profile/87059780057""},{""name"":""Qing Li"",""id"":""/profile/81455606032""},{""name"":""Xueying Zhan"",""id"":""/profile/99659079260""},{""name"":""Yaowei Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659352308""},{""name"":""Yanghui Rao"",""id"":""/profile/87059780057""},{""name"":""Qing Li"",""id"":""/profile/81455606032""}]","[""Shenghua Bao, Shengliang Xu, Li Zhang, Rong Yan, Zhong Su, Dingyi Han, and Yong Yu. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3309547,Temporal Relational Ranking for Stock Prediction,"Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to help investors make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a promising choice for stock prediction.However, most existing deep learning solutions are not optimized toward the target of investment, i.e., selecting the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trends) or a regression problem (to predict stock prices). More importantly, they largely treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing solutions in two major aspects: (1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock ranking, and (2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.","[{""name"":""Fuli Feng"",""id"":""/profile/99659190553""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Xiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659076634""},{""name"":""Cheng Luo"",""id"":""/profile/99658989981""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Fuli Feng"",""id"":""/profile/99659190553""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Xiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659076634""},{""name"":""Cheng Luo"",""id"":""/profile/99658989981""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""}]","[""Ayodele Ariyo Adebiyi, Aderemi Oluyinka Adewumi, and Charles Korede Ayo. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3309546,Attentive Aspect Modeling for Review-Aware Recommendation,"In recent years, many studies extract aspects from user reviews and integrate them with ratings for improving the recommendation performance. The common aspects mentioned in a user’s reviews and a product’s reviews indicate indirect connections between the user and product. However, these aspect-based methods suffer from two problems. First, the common aspects are usually very sparse, which is caused by the sparsity of user-product interactions and the diversity of individual users’ vocabularies. Second, a user’s interests on aspects could be different with respect to different products, which are usually assumed to be static in existing methods. In this article, we propose an Attentive Aspect-based Recommendation Model (AARM) to tackle these challenges. For the first problem, to enrich the aspect connections between user and product, besides common aspects, AARM also models the interactions between synonymous and similar aspects. For the second problem, a neural attention network which simultaneously considers user, product, and aspect information is constructed to capture a user’s attention toward aspects when examining different products. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that AARM can effectively alleviate the two aforementioned problems and significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation methods on the top-N recommendation task.","[{""name"":""Xinyu Guan"",""id"":""/profile/99659357422""},{""name"":""Zhiyong Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/87958925057""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Yongfeng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659562138""},{""name"":""Zhibo Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/99659357770""},{""name"":""Qinke Peng"",""id"":""/profile/81453624531""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Xinyu Guan"",""id"":""/profile/99659357422""},{""name"":""Zhiyong Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/87958925057""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Yongfeng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659562138""},{""name"":""Zhibo Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/99659357770""},{""name"":""Qinke Peng"",""id"":""/profile/81453624531""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""}]","[""Konstantin Bauman, Bing Liu, and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2017.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3309994,On Annotation Methodologies for Image Search Evaluation,"Image search engines differ significantly from general web search engines in the way of presenting search results. The difference leads to different interaction and examination behavior patterns, and therefore requires changes in evaluation methodologies. However, evaluation of image search still utilizes the methods for general web search. In particular, offline metrics are calculated based on coarse-fine topical relevance judgments with the assumption that users examine results in a sequential manner.In this article, we investigate annotation methods via crowdsourcing for image search evaluation based on a lab-based user study. Using user satisfaction as the golden standard, we make several interesting findings. First, instead of item-based annotation, annotating relevance in a row-based way is more efficient without hurting performance. Second, besides topical relevance, image quality plays a crucial role when evaluating the image search results, and the importance of image quality changes with search intent. Third, compared to traditional four-level scales, the fine-grain annotation method outperforms significantly. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to systematically study how diverse factors in data annotation impact image search evaluation. Our results suggest different strategies for exploiting the crowdsourcing to get data annotated under different conditions.","[{""name"":""Yunqiu Shao"",""id"":""/profile/99659281601""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Fan Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99658990091""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Yunqiu Shao"",""id"":""/profile/99659281601""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Fan Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99658990091""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""}]","[""Azzah Al-Maskari, Mark Sanderson, and Paul Clough. 2007.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3310364,Using Collection Shards to Study Retrieval Performance Effect Sizes,"Despite the bulk of research studying how to more accurately compare the performance of IR systems, less attention is devoted to better understanding the different factors that play a role in such performance and how they interact. This is the case of shards, i.e., partitioning a document collection into sub-parts, which are used for many different purposes, ranging from efficiency to selective search or making test collection evaluation more accurate. In all these cases, there is empirical knowledge supporting the importance of shards, but we lack actual models that allow us to measure the impact of shards on system performance and how they interact with topics and systems. We use the general linear mixed model framework and present a model that encompasses the experimental factors of system, topic, shard, and their interaction effects. This detailed model allows us to more accurately estimate differences between the effect of various factors. We study shards created by a range of methods used in prior work and better explain observations noted in prior work in a principled setting and offer new insights. Notably, we discover that the topic*shard interaction effect, in particular, is a large effect almost globally across all datasets, an observation that, to our knowledge, has not been measured before.","[{""name"":""Nicola Ferro"",""id"":""/profile/81100482049""},{""name"":""Yubin Kim"",""id"":""/profile/99659356196""},{""name"":""Mark Sanderson"",""id"":""/profile/81100454785""},{""name"":""Nicola Ferro"",""id"":""/profile/81100482049""},{""name"":""Yubin Kim"",""id"":""/profile/99659356196""},{""name"":""Mark Sanderson"",""id"":""/profile/81100454785""}]","[""J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3312528,Personalised Reranking of Paper Recommendations Using Paper Content and User Behavior,"Academic search engines have been widely used to access academic papers, where users’ information needs are explicitly represented as search queries. Some modern recommender systems have taken one step further by predicting users’ information needs without the presence of an explicit query. In this article, we examine an academic paper recommender that sends out paper recommendations in email newsletters, based on the users’ browsing history on the academic search engine. Specifically, we look at users who regularly browse papers on the search engine, and we sign up for the recommendation newsletters for the first time. We address the task of reranking the recommendation candidates that are generated by a production system for such users.We face the challenge that the users on whom we focus have not interacted with the recommender system before, which is a common scenario that every recommender system encounters when new users sign up. We propose an approach to reranking candidate recommendations that utilizes both paper content and user behavior. The approach is designed to suit the characteristics unique to our academic recommendation setting. For instance, content similarity measures can be used to find the closest match between candidate recommendations and the papers previously browsed by the user. To this end, we use a knowledge graph derived from paper metadata to compare entity similarities (papers, authors, and journals) in the embedding space. Since the users on whom we focus have no prior interactions with the recommender system, we propose a model to learn a mapping from users’ browsed articles to user clicks on the recommendations. We combine both content and behavior into a hybrid reranking model that outperforms the production baseline significantly, providing a relative 13% increase in Mean Average Precision and 28% in [email protected]Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the model components, highlighting where the performance boost comes from. The obtained insights reveal useful components for the reranking process and can be generalized to other academic recommendation settings as well, such as the utility of graph embedding similarity. Also, recent papers browsed by users provide stronger evidence for recommendation than historical ones.","[{""name"":""Xinyi Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659356545""},{""name"":""Yifan Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659314607""},{""name"":""Benjamin Pettit"",""id"":""/profile/99659172341""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Xinyi Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659356545""},{""name"":""Yifan Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659314607""},{""name"":""Benjamin Pettit"",""id"":""/profile/99659172341""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""}]","[""Fabio Aiolli. 2013.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3312738,Exploring High-Order User Preference on the Knowledge Graph for Recommender Systems,"To address the sparsity and cold-start problem of collaborative filtering, researchers usually make use of side information, such as social networks or item attributes, to improve the performance of recommendation. In this article, we consider the knowledge graph (KG) as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for KG-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet, an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the KG into recommender systems. RippleNet has two versions: (1) The outward propagation version, which is analogous to the actual ripples on water, stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user’s potential interests along links in the KG. The multiple “ripples” activated by a user’s historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item. (2) The inward aggregation version aggregates and incorporates the neighborhood information biasedly when computing the representation of a given entity. The neighborhood can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity and capture users’ long-distance interests. In addition, we intuitively demonstrate how a KG assists with recommender systems in RippleNet, and we also find that RippleNet provides a new perspective of explainability for the recommended results in terms of the KG. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that both versions of RippleNet achieve substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book, and news recommendations, over several state-of-the-art baselines.","[{""name"":""Hongwei Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659218608""},{""name"":""Fuzheng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/83058629357""},{""name"":""Jialin Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659317691""},{""name"":""Miao Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659217318""},{""name"":""Wenjie Li"",""id"":""/profile/81100480838""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Minyi Guo"",""id"":""/profile/81100085104""},{""name"":""Hongwei Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659218608""},{""name"":""Fuzheng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/83058629357""},{""name"":""Jialin Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659317691""},{""name"":""Miao Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659217318""},{""name"":""Wenjie Li"",""id"":""/profile/81100480838""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Minyi Guo"",""id"":""/profile/81100085104""}]","[""Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3314578,Deep Item-based Collaborative Filtering for Top-N Recommendation,"Item-based Collaborative Filtering (ICF) has been widely adopted in recommender systems in industry, owing to its strength in user interest modeling and ease in online personalization. By constructing a user’s profile with the items that the user has consumed, ICF recommends items that are similar to the user’s profile. With the prevalence of machine learning in recent years, significant processes have been made for ICF by learning item similarity (or representation) from data. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing works have only considered linear and shallow relationships between items, which are insufficient to capture the complicated decision-making process of users.In this article, we propose a more expressive ICF solution by accounting for the nonlinear and higher-order relationships among items. Going beyond modeling only the second-order interaction (e.g., similarity) between two items, we additionally consider the interaction among all interacted item pairs by using nonlinear neural networks. By doing this, we can effectively model the higher-order relationship among items, capturing more complicated effects in user decision-making. For example, it can differentiate which historical itemsets in a user’s profile are more important in affecting the user to make a purchase decision on an item. We treat this solution as a deep variant of ICF, thus term it as DeepICF. To justify our proposal, we perform empirical studies on two public datasets from MovieLens and Pinterest. Extensive experiments verify the highly positive effect of higher-order item interaction modeling with nonlinear neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that by more fine-grained second-order interaction modeling with attention network, the performance of our DeepICF method can be further improved.","[{""name"":""Feng Xue"",""id"":""/profile/99659346370""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Xiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659076634""},{""name"":""Jiandong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/99659362637""},{""name"":""Kai Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659362668""},{""name"":""Richang Hong"",""id"":""/profile/81444592384""},{""name"":""Feng Xue"",""id"":""/profile/99659346370""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Xiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659076634""},{""name"":""Jiandong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/99659362637""},{""name"":""Kai Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659362668""},{""name"":""Richang Hong"",""id"":""/profile/81444592384""}]","[""Avi Arampatzis and Georgios Kalamatianos. 2018.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3317612,Memory-Augmented Dialogue Management for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"Dialogue management (DM) is responsible for predicting the next action of a dialogue system according to the current dialogue state and thus plays a central role in task-oriented dialogue systems. Since DM requires having access not only to local utterances but also to the global semantics of the entire dialogue session, modeling the long-range history information is a critical issue. To this end, we propose MAD, a novel memory-augmented dialogue management model that employs a memory controller and two additional memory structures (i.e., a slot-value memory and an external memory). The slot-value memory tracks the dialogue state by memorizing and updating the values of semantic slots (i.e., cuisine, price, and location), and the external memory augments the representation of hidden states of traditional recurrent neural networks by storing more context information. To update the dialogue state efficiently, we also propose slot-level attention on user utterances to extract specific semantic information for each slot. Experiments show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing baselines.","[{""name"":""Zheng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659370987""},{""name"":""Minlie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81430592684""},{""name"":""Zhongzhou Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659218360""},{""name"":""Feng Ji"",""id"":""/profile/81490670707""},{""name"":""Haiqing Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659217477""},{""name"":""Xiaoyan Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81438595316""},{""name"":""Zheng Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659370987""},{""name"":""Minlie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81430592684""},{""name"":""Zhongzhou Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659218360""},{""name"":""Feng Ji"",""id"":""/profile/81490670707""},{""name"":""Haiqing Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659217477""},{""name"":""Xiaoyan Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81438595316""}]","[""Martín Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3320118,Does Diversity Affect User Satisfaction in Image Search,"Diversity has been taken into consideration by existing Web image search engines in ranking search results. However, there is no thorough investigation of how diversity affects user satisfaction in image search. In this article, we address the following questions: (1) How do different factors, such as content and visual presentations, affect users’ perception of diversity? (2) How does search result diversity affect user satisfaction with different search intents? To answer those questions, we conduct a set of laboratory user studies to collect users’ perceived diversity annotations and search satisfaction. We find that the existence of nearly duplicated image results has the largest impact on users’ perceived diversity, followed by the similarity in content and visual presentations. Besides these findings, we also investigate the relationship between diversity and satisfaction in image search. Specifically, we find that users’ preference for diversity varies across different search intents. When users want to collect information or save images for further usage (the Locate search tasks), more diversified result lists lead to higher satisfaction levels. The insights may help commercial image search engines to design better result ranking strategies and evaluation metrics.","[{""name"":""Zhijing Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659191974""},{""name"":""Ke Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81490680337""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Zhijing Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659191974""},{""name"":""Ke Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81490680337""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""}]","[""Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Alan Halverson, and Samuel Ieong. 2009.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3322128,"The Effects of Working Memory, Perceptual Speed, and Inhibition in Aggregated Search","Prior work has studied how different characteristics of individual users (e.g., personality traits and cognitive abilities) can impact search behaviors and outcomes. We report on a laboratory study (N = 32) that investigated the effects of three different cognitive abilities (perceptual speed, working memory, and inhibition) in the context of aggregated search. Aggregated search systems combine results from multiple heterogeneous sources (or verticals) in a unified presentation. Participants in our study interacted with two different aggregated search interfaces (a within-subjects design) that differed based on the extent to which the layout distinguished between results originating from different verticals. The interleaved interface merged results from different verticals in a fairly unconstrained fashion. Conversely, the blocked interface displayed results from the same vertical as a group, displayed each group of vertical results in the same region on the SERP for every query, and used a border around each group of vertical results to help distinguish among results from different sources. We investigated three research questions (RQ1--RQ3). Specifically, we investigated the effects of the interface condition and each cognitive ability on three types of outcomes: (RQ1) participants’ levels of workload, (RQ2) participants’ levels of user engagement, and (RQ3) participants’ search behaviors. Our results found different main and interaction effects. Perceptual speed and inhibition did not significantly affect participants’ workload and user engagement but significantly affected their search behaviors. Specifically, with the interleaved interface, participants with lower perceptual speed had more difficulty finding relevant results on the SERP, and participants with lower inhibitory attention control searched at a slower pace. Working memory did not have a strong effect on participants’ behaviors but had several significant effects on the levels of workload and user engagement reported by participants. Specifically, participants with lower working memory reported higher levels of workload and lower levels of user engagement. We discuss implications of our results for designing aggregated search interfaces that are well suited for users with different cognitive abilities.","[{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Bogeum Choi"",""id"":""/profile/99659281714""},{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Bogeum Choi"",""id"":""/profile/99659281714""}]","[""Azzah Al-Maskari and Mark Sanderson. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3326065,Funnelling: A New Ensemble Method for Heterogeneous Transfer Learning and Its Application to Cross-Lingual Text Classification,"Cross-lingual Text Classification (CLC) consists of automatically classifying, according to a common set C of classes, documents each written in one of a set of languages L, and doing so more accurately than when “naïvely” classifying each document via its corresponding language-specific classifier. To obtain an increase in the classification accuracy for a given language, the system thus needs to also leverage the training examples written in the other languages. We tackle “multilabel” CLC via funnelling, a new ensemble learning method that we propose here. Funnelling consists of generating a two-tier classification system where all documents, irrespective of language, are classified by the same (second-tier) classifier. For this classifier, all documents are represented in a common, language-independent feature space consisting of the posterior probabilities generated by first-tier, language-dependent classifiers. This allows the classification of all test documents, of any language, to benefit from the information present in all training documents, of any language. We present substantial experiments, run on publicly available multilingual text collections, in which funnelling is shown to significantly outperform a number of state-of-the-art baselines. All code and datasets (in vector form) are made publicly available.","[{""name"":""Andrea Esuli"",""id"":""/profile/81309512045""},{""name"":""Alejandro Moreo"",""id"":""/profile/81500655400""},{""name"":""Fabrizio Sebastiani"",""id"":""/profile/81100172159""},{""name"":""Andrea Esuli"",""id"":""/profile/81309512045""},{""name"":""Alejandro Moreo"",""id"":""/profile/81500655400""},{""name"":""Fabrizio Sebastiani"",""id"":""/profile/81100172159""}]","[""Georgios Balikas and Massih-Reza Amini. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3329188,Search Result Reranking with Visual and Structure Information Sources,"Relevance estimation is among the most important tasks in the ranking of search results. Current methodologies mainly concentrate on text matching, link analysis, and user behavior models. However, users judge the relevance of search results directly from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), which provide valuable signals for reranking. In this article, we propose two different approaches to aggregate the visual, structure, as well as textual information sources of search results in relevance estimation. The first one is a late-fusion framework named Joint Relevance Estimation model (JRE). JRE estimates the relevance independently from screenshots, textual contents, and HTML source codes of search results and jointly makes the final decision through an inter-modality attention mechanism. The second one is an early-fusion framework named Tree-based Deep Neural Network (TreeNN), which embeds the texts and images into the HTML parse tree through a recursive process. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, we construct a large-scale practical Search Result Relevance (SRR) dataset that consists of multiple information sources and relevance labels of over 60,000 search results. Experimental results show that the proposed two models achieve better performance than state-of-the-art ranking solutions as well as the original rankings of commercial search engines.","[{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Junqi Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659316428""},{""name"":""Jiaxin Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99659048090""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Qi Tian"",""id"":""/profile/81423592672""},{""name"":""Yanxiong Lu"",""id"":""/profile/99659442440""},{""name"":""Leyu Lin"",""id"":""/profile/99659441703""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Junqi Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659316428""},{""name"":""Jiaxin Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99659048090""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Qi Tian"",""id"":""/profile/81423592672""},{""name"":""Yanxiong Lu"",""id"":""/profile/99659442440""},{""name"":""Leyu Lin"",""id"":""/profile/99659441703""}]","[""Javad Azimi, Ruofei Zhang, Zhou Yang, Vidhya Navalpakkam, Jianchang Mao, and Xiaoli Fern. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3343117,Joint Neural Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems,"We propose a Joint Neural Collaborative Filtering (J-NCF) method for recommender systems. The J-NCF model applies a joint neural network that couples deep feature learning and deep interaction modeling with a rating matrix. Deep feature learning extracts feature representations of users and items with a deep learning architecture based on a user-item rating matrix. Deep interaction modeling captures non-linear user-item interactions with a deep neural network using the feature representations generated by the deep feature learning process as input. J-NCF enables the deep feature learning and deep interaction modeling processes to optimize each other through joint training, which leads to improved recommendation performance. In addition, we design a new loss function for optimization that takes both implicit and explicit feedback, point-wise and pair-wise loss into account.Experiments on several real-world datasets show significant improvements of J-NCF over state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of up to 8.24% on the MovieLens 100K dataset, 10.81% on the MovieLens 1M dataset, and 10.21% on the Amazon Movies dataset in terms of [email protected] [email protected] improvements are 12.42%, 14.24%, and 15.06%, respectively. We also conduct experiments to evaluate the scalability and sensitivity of J-NCF. Our experiments show that the J-NCF model has a competitive recommendation performance with inactive users and different degrees of data sparsity when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.","[{""name"":""Wanyu Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659190149""},{""name"":""Fei Cai"",""id"":""/profile/81309501210""},{""name"":""Honghui Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81453637355""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Wanyu Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659190149""},{""name"":""Fei Cai"",""id"":""/profile/81309501210""},{""name"":""Honghui Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81453637355""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""}]","[""David Adedayo Adeniyi, Zhaoqiang Wei, and Yongquan Yang. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3345557,Question Answering in Knowledge Bases: A Verification Assisted Model with Iterative Training,"Question answering over knowledge bases aims to take full advantage of the information in knowledge bases with the ultimate purpose of returning answers to questions. To access the substantial knowledge within the KB, many model architectures are hindered by the bottleneck of accurately predicting relations that connect subject entities in questions to object entities in the knowledge base. To break the bottleneck, this article presents a novel model architecture, APVA, which includes a verification mechanism to check the correctness of predicted relations. Specifically, APVA takes advantage of KB-based information to improve relation prediction but verifies the correctness of the predicted relation by means of simple negative sampling in a logistic regression framework. The APVA architecture offers a natural way to integrate an iterative training procedure, which we call turbo training. Accordingly, we introduce APVA-TURBO to perform question answering over knowledge bases. We demonstrate extensive experiments to show that APVA-TURBO outperforms existing approaches on question answering.","[{""name"":""Richong Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81508689241""},{""name"":""Yue Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659468127""},{""name"":""Yongyi Mao"",""id"":""/profile/81538346656""},{""name"":""Jinpeng Huai"",""id"":""/profile/81100057493""},{""name"":""Richong Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81508689241""},{""name"":""Yue Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659468127""},{""name"":""Yongyi Mao"",""id"":""/profile/81538346656""},{""name"":""Jinpeng Huai"",""id"":""/profile/81100057493""}]","[""Sören Auer, Christian Bizer, Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak, and Zachary Ives. 2007.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3345001,Boosting Search Performance Using Query Variations,"Rank fusion is a powerful technique that allows multiple sources of information to be combined into a single result set. Query variations covering the same information need represent one way in which different sources of information might arise. However, when implemented in the obvious manner, fusion over query variations is not cost-effective, at odds with the usual web-search requirement for strict per-query efficiency guarantees. In this work, we propose a novel solution to query fusion by splitting the computation into two parts: one phase that is carried out offline, to generate pre-computed centroid answers for queries addressing broadly similar information needs, and then a second online phase that uses the corresponding topic centroid to compute a result page for each query. To achieve this, we make use of score-based fusion algorithms whose costs can be amortized via the pre-processing step and that can then be efficiently combined during subsequent per-query re-ranking operations. Experimental results using the ClueWeb12B collection and the UQV100 query variations demonstrate that centroid-based approaches allow improved retrieval effectiveness at little or no loss in query throughput or latency and within reasonable pre-processing requirements. We additionally show that queries that do not match any of the pre-computed clusters can be accurately identified and efficiently processed in our proposed ranking pipeline.","[{""name"":""Rodger Benham"",""id"":""/profile/99659233034""},{""name"":""Joel Mackenzie"",""id"":""/profile/99658766771""},{""name"":""Alistair Moffat"",""id"":""/profile/81100200925""},{""name"":""J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3349527,Offline versus Online Representation Learning of Documents Using External Knowledge,"An intensive recent research work investigated the combined use of hand-curated knowledge resources and corpus-driven resources to learn effective text representations. The overall learning process could be run by online revising the learning objective or by offline refining an original learned representation. The differentiated impact of each of the learning approaches on the quality of the learned representations has not been studied so far in the literature. This article focuses on the design of comparable offline vs. online knowledge-enhanced document representation learning models and the comparison of their effectiveness using a set of standard IR and NLP downstream tasks. The results of quantitative and qualitative analyses show that (1) offline vs. online learning approaches have dissimilar result trends regarding the task as well as the dataset distribution counts with regard to domain application; (2) while considering external knowledge resources is undoubtedly beneficial, the way used to express relational constraints could affect semantic inference effectiveness. The findings of this work present opportunities for the design of future representation learning models, but also for providing insights about the evaluation of such models.","[{""name"":""Lynda Tamine"",""id"":""/profile/81100274818""},{""name"":""Laure Soulier"",""id"":""/profile/81502808955""},{""name"":""Gia-Hung Nguyen"",""id"":""/profile/99659081884""},{""name"":""Nathalie Souf"",""id"":""/profile/99659166085""},{""name"":""Lynda Tamine"",""id"":""/profile/81100274818""},{""name"":""Laure Soulier"",""id"":""/profile/81502808955""},{""name"":""Gia-Hung Nguyen"",""id"":""/profile/99659081884""},{""name"":""Nathalie Souf"",""id"":""/profile/99659166085""}]","[""Qingyao Ai, Liu Yang, Jiafeng Guo, and W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3360486,Constructing Click Model for Mobile Search with Viewport Time,"A series of click models has been proposed to extract accurate and unbiased relevance feedback from valuable yet noisy click-through data in search logs. Previous works have shown that users search behavior in mobile and desktop scenarios are rather different in many aspects, therefore, the click models designed for desktop search may not be effective in the mobile context. To address this problem, we propose two novel click models for mobile search: (1) Mobile Click Model (MCM), which models click necessity bias and examination satisfaction bias; (2) Viewport Time Click Model (VTCM), which further extends MCM by utilizing the viewport time. Extensive experiments on large-scale real mobile search logs show that: (1) MCM and VTCM outperform existing models in predicting users’ clicks and estimating result relevance; (2) MCM and VTCM can extract richer information, such as the click necessity of search results and the probability of user satisfaction, from mobile click logs; (3) By modeling the viewport time distributions of heterogeneous results, VTCM can bring a significant improvement over MCM in click prediction and relevance estimation tasks. Our proposed click models can help better understand user behavior patterns in mobile search and improve the ranking performance of mobile search engines.","[{""name"":""Yukun Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659190527""},{""name"":""Jiaxin Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99659048090""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Cheng Luo"",""id"":""/profile/99658989981""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Yukun Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659190527""},{""name"":""Jiaxin Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99659048090""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Cheng Luo"",""id"":""/profile/99658989981""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""}]","[""Alexey Borisov, Ilya Markov, Maarten de Rijke, and Pavel Serdyukov. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3360487,Relevance Feedback: The Whole Is Inferior to the Sum of Its Parts,"Document retrieval methods that utilize relevance feedback often induce a single query model from the set of feedback documents, specifically, the relevant documents. We empirically show that for a few state-of-the-art query-model induction methods, retrieval performance can be significantly improved by constructing the query model from a subset of the relevant documents rather than from all of them. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new approach for relevance-feedback-based retrieval. The approach, derived from the risk minimization framework, is based on utilizing multiple query models induced from all subsets of the given relevant documents. Empirical evaluation shows that the approach posts performance that is statistically significantly better than that of applying the standard practice of utilizing a single query model induced from the relevant documents. While the average relative improvements are small to moderate, the robustness of the approach is substantially higher than that of a variety of reference comparison methods that address various challenges in using relevance feedback.","[{""name"":""Fiana Raiber"",""id"":""/profile/81472653708""},{""name"":""Oren Kurland"",""id"":""/profile/81100462276""},{""name"":""Fiana Raiber"",""id"":""/profile/81472653708""},{""name"":""Oren Kurland"",""id"":""/profile/81100462276""}]","[""Nasreen Abdul-Jaleel, James Allan, W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3360488,Adaptive Local Low-rank Matrix Approximation for Recommendation,"Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) has attracted more and more attention in the community of recommendation. Even though LRMA-based recommendation methods (including Global LRMA and Local LRMA) obtain promising results, they suffer from the complicated structure of the large-scale and sparse rating matrix, especially when the underlying system includes a large set of items with various types and a huge amount of users with diverse interests. Thus, they have to predefine the important parameters, such as the rank of the rating matrix and the number of submatrices. Moreover, most existing Local LRMA methods are usually designed in a two-phase separated framework and do not consider the missing mechanisms of rating matrix. In this article, a non-parametric unified Bayesian graphical model is proposed for Adaptive Local low-rank Matrix Approximation (ALoMA). ALoMA has ability to simultaneously identify rating submatrices, determine the optimal rank for each submatrix, and learn the submatrix-specific user/item latent factors. Meanwhile, the missing mechanism is adopted to characterize the whole rating matrix. These four parts are seamlessly integrated and enhance each other in a unified framework. Specifically, the user-item rating matrix is adaptively divided into proper number of submatrices in ALoMA by exploiting the Chinese Restaurant Process. For each submatrix, by considering both global/local structure information and missing mechanisms, the latent user/item factors are identified in an optimal latent space by adopting automatic relevance determination technique. We theoretically analyze the model’s generalization error bounds and give an approximation guarantee. Furthermore, an efficient Gibbs sampling-based algorithm is designed to infer the proposed model. A series of experiments have been conducted on six real-world datasets (Epinions, Douban, Dianping, Yelp, Movielens (10M), and Netflix). The results demonstrate that ALoMA outperforms the state-of-the-art LRMA-based methods and can easily provide interpretable recommendation results.","[{""name"":""Huafeng Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659088439""},{""name"":""Liping Jing"",""id"":""/profile/81344492532""},{""name"":""Yuhua Qian"",""id"":""/profile/81338490464""},{""name"":""Jian Yu"",""id"":""/profile/81438594804""},{""name"":""Huafeng Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659088439""},{""name"":""Liping Jing"",""id"":""/profile/81344492532""},{""name"":""Yuhua Qian"",""id"":""/profile/81338490464""},{""name"":""Jian Yu"",""id"":""/profile/81438594804""}]","[""Michal Aharon, Michal Elad, and Alfred Bruckstein. 2006.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3354187,Next and Next New POI Recommendation via Latent Behavior Pattern Inference,"Next and next new point-of-interest (POI) recommendation are essential instruments in promoting customer experiences and business operations related to locations. However, due to the sparsity of the check-in records, they still remain insufficiently studied. In this article, we propose to utilize personalized latent behavior patterns learned from contextual features, e.g., time of day, day of week, and location category, to improve the effectiveness of the recommendations. Two variations of models are developed, including GPDM, which learns a fixed pattern distribution for all users; and PPDM, which learns personalized pattern distribution for each user. In both models, a soft-max function is applied to integrate the personalized Markov chain with the latent patterns, and a sequential Bayesian Personalized Ranking (S-BPR) is applied as the optimization criterion. Then, Expectation Maximization (EM) is in charge of finding optimized model parameters. Extensive experiments on three large-scale commonly adopted real-world LBSN data sets prove that the inclusion of location category and latent patterns helps to boost the performance of POI recommendations. Specifically, our models in general significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods for both next and next new POI recommendation tasks. Moreover, our models are capable of making accurate recommendations regardless of the short/long duration or distance.","[{""name"":""Xin Li"",""id"":""/profile/81416609442""},{""name"":""Dongcheng Han"",""id"":""/profile/99659467222""},{""name"":""Jing He"",""id"":""/profile/99659085838""},{""name"":""Lejian Liao"",""id"":""/profile/81339513628""},{""name"":""Mingzhong Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81436593746""},{""name"":""Xin Li"",""id"":""/profile/81416609442""},{""name"":""Dongcheng Han"",""id"":""/profile/99659467222""},{""name"":""Jing He"",""id"":""/profile/99659085838""},{""name"":""Lejian Liao"",""id"":""/profile/81339513628""},{""name"":""Mingzhong Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81436593746""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3357154,Modeling Embedding Dimension Correlations via Convolutional Neural Collaborative Filtering,"As the core of recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) models the affinity between a user and an item from historical user-item interactions, such as clicks, purchases, and so on. Benefiting from the strong representation power, neural networks have recently revolutionized the recommendation research, setting up a new standard for CF. However, existing neural recommender models do not explicitly consider the correlations among embedding dimensions, making them less effective in modeling the interaction function between users and items. In this work, we emphasize on modeling the correlations among embedding dimensions in neural networks to pursue higher effectiveness for CF. We propose a novel and general neural collaborative filtering framework—namely, ConvNCF, which is featured with two designs: (1) applying outer product on user embedding and item embedding to explicitly model the pairwise correlations between embedding dimensions, and (2) employing convolutional neural network above the outer product to learn the high-order correlations among embedding dimensions. To justify our proposal, we present three instantiations of ConvNCF by using different inputs to represent a user and conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Extensive results verify the utility of modeling embedding dimension correlations with ConvNCF, which outperforms several competitive CF methods.","[{""name"":""Xiaoyu Du"",""id"":""/profile/99659281549""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Fajie Yuan"",""id"":""/profile/99658983008""},{""name"":""Jinhui Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81320495810""},{""name"":""Zhiguang Qin"",""id"":""/profile/81321496742""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Xiaoyu Du"",""id"":""/profile/99659281549""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Fajie Yuan"",""id"":""/profile/99658983008""},{""name"":""Jinhui Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81320495810""},{""name"":""Zhiguang Qin"",""id"":""/profile/81321496742""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""}]","[""Ting Bai, Ji-Rong Wen, Jun Zhang, and Wayne Xin Zhao. 2017.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3352592,Enhancing Personalized Recommendation by Implicit Preference Communities Modeling,"Recommender systems aim to capture user preferences and provide accurate recommendations to users accordingly. For each user, there usually exist others with similar preferences, and a collection of users may also have similar preferences with each other, thus forming a community. However, such communities may not necessarily be explicitly given, and the users inside the same communities may not know each other; they are formally defined and named Implicit Preference Communities (IPCs) in this article. By enriching user preferences with the information of other users in the communities, the performance of recommender systems can also be enhanced.Historical explicit ratings are a good resource to construct the IPCs of users but is usually sparse. Meanwhile, user preferences are easily affected by their social connections, which can be jointly used for IPC modeling with the ratings. However, this imposes two challenges for model design. First, the rating and social domains are heterogeneous; thus, it is challenging to coordinate social information and rating behaviors for a same learning task. Therefore, transfer learning is a good strategy for IPC modeling. Second, the communities are not explicitly labeled, and existing supervised learning approaches do not fit the requirement of IPC modeling. As co-clustering is an effective unsupervised learning approach for discovering block structures in high-dimensional data, it is a cornerstone for discovering the structure of IPCs.In this article, we propose a recommendation model with Implicit Preference Communities from user ratings and social connections. To tackle the unsupervised learning limitation, we design a Bayesian probabilistic graphical model to capture the IPC structure for recommendation. Meanwhile, following the spirit of transfer learning, both rating behaviors and social connections are introduced into the model by parameter sharing. Moreover, Gibbs sampling-based algorithms are proposed for parameter inferences of the models. Furthermore, to meet the need for online scenarios when the data arrive sequentially as a stream, a novel online sampling-based parameter inference algorithm for recommendation is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose and formally define the concept of IPC.","[{""name"":""Xiao Lin"",""id"":""/profile/99658635431""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Xiao Lin"",""id"":""/profile/99658635431""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""}]","[""Jacob Abernethy, Kevin Canini, John Langford, and Alex Simma. 2007.
