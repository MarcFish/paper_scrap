https://doi.org/10.1145/2934671,Accounting for Language Changes Over Time in Document Similarity Search,"Given a query document, ranking the documents in a collection based on how similar they are to the query is an essential task with extensive applications. For collections that contain documents whose creation dates span several decades, this task is further complicated by the fact that the language changes over time. For example, many terms add or lose one or more senses to meet people’s evolving needs. To address this problem, we present methods that take advantage of two types of information to account for the language change. The first is the citation network that often exists within the collection, which can be used to link related documents with significantly different creation dates (and hence different language use). The second is the changes in the usage frequency of terms that occur over time, which can indicate changes in their senses and uses. These methods utilize the preceding information while estimating the representation of both documents and terms within the context of nonprobabilistic static and dynamic topic models. Our experiments on two real-world datasets that span more than 40 years show that our proposed methods improve the retrieval performance of existing models and that these improvements are statistically significant.","[{""name"":""Sara Morsy"",""id"":""/profile/81548013894""},{""name"":""George Karypis"",""id"":""/profile/81100008465""},{""name"":""Sara Morsy"",""id"":""/profile/81548013894""},{""name"":""George Karypis"",""id"":""/profile/81100008465""}]","[""Amr Ahmed and Eric P.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2935747,The Effects of Aggregated Search Coherence on Search Behavior,"Aggregated search is the task of combining results from multiple independent search systems in a single Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Aggregated search coherence refers to the extent to which different sources on the SERP focus on similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. In previous studies, we found that the query senses in a set of vertical results can influence user engagement with the web results (the so-called “spillover” effect). In this work, we investigate five research questions (RQ1--RQ5) that extend our prior work. First, we investigate the extent to which results from different sources focus on different senses of an ambiguous query (RQ1). Second, we investigate how the vertical-to-web spillover effect varies across different verticals (RQ2). Then, we examine whether the level of spillover depends on the vertical position (RQ3) and on whether the vertical results are displayed with a border and different-colored background to distinguish them from the web results (RQ4). Finally, we propose a new method for displaying results from a particular vertical that are more consistent with the query senses in the web results (RQ5). We evaluate this new method based on how it influences users to make more correct decisions with respect to the web results—to engage with the web results when at least one of them is relevant and to avoid engaging with the web results otherwise. Our results show the following trends. In terms of RQ1, our analysis suggests that the top results from the web search engine are more diversified than the top results from our four different verticals considered (images, news, shopping, and video). In terms of RQ2, we found a stronger spillover effect for the images vertical than the news, shopping, and video verticals. In terms of RQ3, we found a stronger level of spillover when the vertical was positioned at the top of the SERP versus to the right side of the web results. In terms of RQ4, we found an interesting additive effect between the vertical’s position and displaying the vertical results enclosed in a border and with a different-colored background—the image vertical had no spillover when presented to the right side of the web results and with a border and background. Finally, in terms of RQ5, we found that our proposed vertical results selection approach can influence users to make more correct predictions about their level of engagement with the web results.","[{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Rob Capra"",""id"":""/profile/81100419460""},{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Rob Capra"",""id"":""/profile/81100419460""}]","[""Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Alan Halverson, and Samuel Ieong. 2009.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2937752,Causal Relationship Detection in Archival Collections of Product Reviews for Understanding Technology Evolution,"Technology progress is one of the key reasons behind today's rapid changes in lifestyles. Knowing how products and objects evolve can not only help with understanding the evolutionary patterns in our society but can also provide clues on effective product design and can offer support for predicting the future. We propose a general framework for analyzing technology's impact on our lives through detecting cause--effect relationships, where causes represent changes in technology while effects are changes in social life, such as new activities or new ways of using products. We address the challenge of viewing technology evolution through the “social impact lens” by mining causal relationships from the long-term collections of product reviews. In particular, we first propose dividing vocabulary into two groups: terms describing product features (called physical terms) and terms representing product usage (called conceptual terms). We then search for two kinds of changes related to the appearance of terms: frequency-based and context-based changes. The former indicate periods when a word was significantly more frequently used, whereas the latter indicate periods of high change in the word's context. Based on the detected changes, we then search for causal term pairs such that the change in the physical term triggers the change in the conceptual term. We next extend our approach to finding causal relationships between word groups such as a group of words representing the same technology and causing a given conceptual change or group of words representing two different technologies that simultaneously “co-cause” a conceptual change. We conduct experiments on different product types using the Amazon Product Review Dataset, which spans 1995 to 2013, and we demonstrate that our approaches outperform state-of-the-art baselines.","[{""name"":""Yating Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659515855""},{""name"":""Adam Jatowt"",""id"":""/profile/81100259801""},{""name"":""Katsumi Tanaka"",""id"":""/profile/86058923157""},{""name"":""Yating Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659515855""},{""name"":""Adam Jatowt"",""id"":""/profile/81100259801""},{""name"":""Katsumi Tanaka"",""id"":""/profile/86058923157""}]","[""J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2948063,"Social Question Answering: Textual, User, and Network Features for Best Answer Prediction","Community question answering (CQA) sites use a collaborative paradigm to satisfy complex information needs. Although the task of matching questions to their best answers has been tackled for more than a decade, the social question-answering practice is a complex process. The factors influencing the accuracy of question-answer matching are many and hard to disentangle. We approach the task from an application-oriented perspective, probing the space of several dimensions relevant to this problem: features, algorithms, and topics. We gather under a learning to rank framework the most extensive feature set used in literature to date, including 225 features from five different families. We test the power of such features in predicting the best answer to a question on the largest dataset from Yahoo Answers used for this task so far (40M answers) and provide a faceted analysis of the results along different topical areas and question types. We propose a novel family of distributional semantics measures that most of the time can seamlessly replace widely used linguistic similarity features, being more than one order of magnitude faster to compute and providing greater predictive power. The best feature set reaches an improvement between 11% and 26% in [email protected] compared to recent well-established state-of-the-art methods.","[{""name"":""Piero Molino"",""id"":""/profile/81375604666""},{""name"":""Luca Maria Aiello"",""id"":""/profile/81375611194""},{""name"":""Pasquale Lops"",""id"":""/profile/81548022697""},{""name"":""Piero Molino"",""id"":""/profile/81375604666""},{""name"":""Luca Maria Aiello"",""id"":""/profile/81375611194""},{""name"":""Pasquale Lops"",""id"":""/profile/81548022697""}]","[""Lada A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2948065,"Trip Recommendation Meets Real-World Constraints: POI Availability, Diversity, and Traveling Time Uncertainty","As location-based social network (LBSN) services become increasingly popular, trip recommendation that recommends a sequence of points of interest (POIs) to visit for a user emerges as one of many important applications of LBSNs. Personalized trip recommendation tailors to users’ specific tastes by learning from past check-in behaviors of users and their peers. Finding the optimal trip that maximizes user’s experiences for a given time budget constraint is an NP-hard problem and previous solutions do not consider three practical and important constraints. One constraint is POI availability, where a POI may be only available during a certain time window. Another constraint is uncertain traveling time, where the traveling time between two POIs is uncertain. In addition, the diversity of the POIs included in the trip plays an important role in user’s final adoptions. This work presents efficient solutions to personalized trip recommendation by incorporating these constraints and leveraging them to prune the search space. We evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions on real-life LBSN datasets.","[{""name"":""Chenyi Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81335500401""},{""name"":""Hongwei Liang"",""id"":""/profile/99658751036""},{""name"":""Ke Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81553476956""},{""name"":""Chenyi Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81335500401""},{""name"":""Hongwei Liang"",""id"":""/profile/99658751036""},{""name"":""Ke Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81553476956""}]","[""David L.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2950049,Answering Arabic Why-Questions: Baseline vs. RST-Based Approach,"A Question Answering (QA) system is concerned with building a system that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. Compared to other languages, little effort was directed towards QA systems for Arabic. Due to the difficulty of handling why-questions, most Arabic QA systems tend to ignore it. In this article, we specifically address the why-question for Arabic using two different approaches and compare their performance and the quality of their answer. The first is the baseline approach, a generic method that is used to answer all types of questions, including factoid; and for the second approach, we use Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). We evaluate both schemes using a corpus of 700 textual documents in different genres collected from Open Source Arabic Corpora (OSAC), and a set of 100 question-answer pairs. Overall, the performance measures of recall, precision, and [email protected] was 68% (all three measures) for the baseline approach, and 71%, 78%, and 77.4%, respectively, for the RST-based approach. The recently introduced extension of the accuracy, the [email protected] measure, rewards unanswered questions over those wrongly answered.","[{""name"":""Aqil M.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2950050,A Meta-Framework for Modeling the Human Reading Process in Sentiment Analysis,"This article introduces a sentiment analysis approach that adopts the way humans read, interpret, and extract sentiment from text. Our motivation builds on the assumption that human interpretation should lead to the most accurate assessment of sentiment in text. We call this automated process Human Reading for Sentiment (HRS). Previous research in sentiment analysis has produced many frameworks that can fit one or more of the HRS aspects; however, none of these methods has addressed them all in one approach. HRS provides a meta-framework for developing new sentiment analysis methods or improving existing ones. The proposed framework provides a theoretical lens for zooming in and evaluating aspects of any sentiment analysis method to identify gaps for improvements towards matching the human reading process. Key steps in HRS include the automation of humans low-level and high-level cognitive text processing. This methodology paves the way towards the integration of psychology with computational linguistics and machine learning to employ models of pragmatics and discourse analysis for sentiment analysis. HRS is tested with two state-of-the-art methods; one is based on feature engineering, and the other is based on deep learning. HRS highlighted the gaps in both methods and showed improvements for both.","[{""name"":""Ramy Baly"",""id"":""/profile/99659063475""},{""name"":""Roula Hobeica"",""id"":""/profile/81496688287""},{""name"":""Hazem Hajj"",""id"":""/profile/81100325892""},{""name"":""Wassim El-Hajj"",""id"":""/profile/81414609722""},{""name"":""Khaled Bashir Shaban"",""id"":""/profile/81100518195""},{""name"":""Ahmad Al-Sallab"",""id"":""/profile/99658731117""},{""name"":""Ramy Baly"",""id"":""/profile/99659063475""},{""name"":""Roula Hobeica"",""id"":""/profile/81496688287""},{""name"":""Hazem Hajj"",""id"":""/profile/81100325892""},{""name"":""Wassim El-Hajj"",""id"":""/profile/81414609722""},{""name"":""Khaled Bashir Shaban"",""id"":""/profile/81100518195""},{""name"":""Ahmad Al-Sallab"",""id"":""/profile/99658731117""}]","[""Ahmed Abbasi, Hsinchun Chen, and Arab Salem. 2008.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2948064,A Probabilistic Lifestyle-Based Trajectory Model for Social Strength Inference from Human Trajectory Data,"With the pervasiveness of location-based social networks, it becomes increasingly important to consider the social characteristics of locations shared among persons. Several studies have been proposed to infer social strength by using trajectory similarity. However, these studies have two major shortcomings. First, they rely on the explicit co-occurrence of check-in locations. In this situation, a user pair of two friends who seldom share common locations or a user pair of two strangers who heavily share common visited locations will receive an unreliable estimation of the real social strength between them. Second, these studies do not consider how the overall trajectory patterns of users change with the varying of living styles.In this article, we propose a probabilistic generative model to mine latent lifestyle-related patterns from human trajectory data for inferring social strength. It can automatically learn functionality topics consisting of locations with similar service functions and transition probabilities over the set of functionality topics. Furthermore, a lifestyle is modeled as a unique transition probability matrix over the set of functionality topics. A user has a preference distribution over the set of lifestyles, and he or she is able to select over multiple lifestyles to adapt to different living contexts. The learned lifestyle-related patterns are subsequently used as features in a supervised learner for both strength estimation and link prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","[{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Ningnan Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81502664915""},{""name"":""Wenhui Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659069740""},{""name"":""Ji-Rong Wen"",""id"":""/profile/81100357094""},{""name"":""Shan Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81322508855""},{""name"":""Edward Y.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2956235,Cross-Lingual Topic Discovery From Multilingual Search Engine Query Log,"Today, major commercial search engines are operating in a multinational fashion to provide web search services for millions of users who compose search queries by different languages. Hence, the search engine query log, which serves as the backbone of many search engine applications, records millions of users’ search history in a wide spectrum of human languages and demonstrates a strong multilingual phenomenon. However, with its salience, the multilingual nature of a search engine query log is usually ignored by existing works, which usually consider query log entries of different languages as being orthogonal and independent. This kind of oversimplified assumption heavily distorts the underlying structure of web search data. In this article, we pioneer in recognition of the multilingual nature of a query log and make the first attempt to cross the language barrier in query logs. We propose a novel model named Cross-Lingual Query Log Topic Model (CL-QLTM) to analyze query logs from a cross-lingual perspective and derive the latent topics of web search data. The CL-QLTM comprehensively integrates web search data in different languages by collectively utilizing cross-lingual dictionaries, as well as the co-occurrence relations in the query log. In order to relieve the efficiency bottleneck of applying the CL-QLTM on voluminous query logs, we propose an efficient parameter inference algorithm based on the MapReduce computing paradigm. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the CL-QLTM is able to effectively derive cross-lingual topics from multilingual query logs and spawn a wide spectrum of new search engine applications.","[{""name"":""Di Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/81490641876""},{""name"":""Yongxin Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81507682062""},{""name"":""Yuanfeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99659072434""},{""name"":""Di Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/81490641876""},{""name"":""Yongxin Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81507682062""},{""name"":""Yuanfeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99659072434""}]","[""Vamshi Ambati and U.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2960408,Ranking-Oriented Collaborative Filtering: A Listwise Approach,"Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most effective techniques in recommender systems, which can be either rating oriented or ranking oriented. Ranking-oriented CF algorithms demonstrated significant performance gains in terms of ranking accuracy, being able to estimate a precise preference ranking of items for each user rather than the absolute ratings (as rating-oriented CF algorithms do). Conventional memory-based ranking-oriented CF can be referred to as pairwise algorithms. They represent each user as a set of preferences on each pair of items for similarity calculations and predictions. In this study, we propose ListCF, a novel listwise CF paradigm that seeks improvement in both accuracy and efficiency in comparison with pairwise CF. In ListCF, each user is represented as a probability distribution of the permutations over rated items based on the Plackett-Luce model, and the similarity between users is measured based on the Kullback--Leibler divergence between their probability distributions over the set of commonly rated items. Given a target user and the most similar users, ListCF directly predicts a total order of items for each user based on similar users’ probability distributions over permutations of the items. Besides, we also reveal insightful connections among pointwise, pairwise, and listwise CF algorithms from the perspective of the matrix representations. In addition, to make our algorithm more scalable and adaptive, we present an incremental algorithm for ListCF, which allows incrementally updating the similarities between users when certain user submits a new rating or updates an existing rating. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the promise of our approach.","[{""name"":""Shuaiqiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81452602346""},{""name"":""Shanshan Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99658706072""},{""name"":""Tie-Yan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81350580267""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Zhumin Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81435601713""},{""name"":""Jari Veijalainen"",""id"":""/profile/81100300206""},{""name"":""Shuaiqiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81452602346""},{""name"":""Shanshan Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99658706072""},{""name"":""Tie-Yan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81350580267""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Zhumin Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81435601713""},{""name"":""Jari Veijalainen"",""id"":""/profile/81100300206""}]","[""John S.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2873055,Joint Modeling of User Check-in Behaviors for Real-time Point-of-Interest Recommendation,"Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting places, especially when users travel out of town. However, the extreme sparsity of a user-POI matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge, we propose a unified probabilistic generative model, the Topic-Region Model (TRM), to simultaneously discover the semantic, temporal, and spatial patterns of users’ check-in activities, and to model their joint effect on users’ decision making for selection of POIs to visit. To demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of TRM, we investigate how it supports two recommendation scenarios in a unified way, that is, hometown recommendation and out-of-town recommendation. TRM effectively overcomes data sparsity by the complementarity and mutual enhancement of the diverse information associated with users’ check-in activities (e.g., check-in content, time, and location) in the processes of discovering heterogeneous patterns and producing recommendations. To support real-time POI recommendations, we further extend the TRM model to an online learning model, TRM-Online, to track changing user interests and speed up the model training. In addition, based on the learned model, we propose a clustering-based branch and bound algorithm (CBB) to prune the POI search space and facilitate fast retrieval of the top-k recommendations.We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposals on two real-world datasets, including recommendation effectiveness, overcoming the cold-start problem, recommendation efficiency, and model-training efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TRM models, especially TRM-Online, compared with state-of-the-art competitive methods, by making more effective and efficient mobile recommendations. In addition, we study the importance of each type of pattern in the two recommendation scenarios, respectively, and find that exploiting temporal patterns is most important for the hometown recommendation scenario, while the semantic patterns play a dominant role in improving the recommendation effectiveness for out-of-town users.","[{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""},{""name"":""Bin Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81100229109""},{""name"":""Xiaofang Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81408595747""},{""name"":""Weiqing Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99658741487""},{""name"":""Zi Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81317494890""},{""name"":""Shazia Sadiq"",""id"":""/profile/81100238105""},{""name"":""Hongzhi Yin"",""id"":""/profile/81501665075""},{""name"":""Bin Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81100229109""},{""name"":""Xiaofang Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81408595747""},{""name"":""Weiqing Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99658741487""},{""name"":""Zi Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81317494890""},{""name"":""Shazia Sadiq"",""id"":""/profile/81100238105""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2978579,Boosting Recommendation in Unexplored Categories by User Price Preference,"State-of-the-art methods for product recommendation encounter a significant performance drop in categories where a user has no purchase history. This problem needs to be addressed since current online retailers are moving beyond single category and attempting to be diversified. In this article, we investigate the challenging problem of product recommendation in unexplored categories and discover that the price, a factor comparable across categories, can improve the recommendation performance significantly. We introduce the price utility concept to characterize users’ sense of price and propose three different utility functions. We show that user price preference in a category is a distribution and we mine typical user price preference patterns based on three different types of distance between distributions. We fuse user price preference through regularization and joint factorization to boost recommendation performance in both browsing and buying shopping orientations. Experimental results show that fusing user price preference improves performance in a series of recommendation tasks: unexplored category recommendation, product recommendation under a given unexplored category, and product recommendation under generic unexplored categories.","[{""name"":""Jia Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81548785656""},{""name"":""Qin Jin"",""id"":""/profile/83358736257""},{""name"":""Shiwan Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81381591341""},{""name"":""Shenghua Bao"",""id"":""/profile/81453610810""},{""name"":""Li Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659560680""},{""name"":""Zhong Su"",""id"":""/profile/81453629574""},{""name"":""Yong Yu"",""id"":""/profile/81548005779""},{""name"":""Jia Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81548785656""},{""name"":""Qin Jin"",""id"":""/profile/83358736257""},{""name"":""Shiwan Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81381591341""},{""name"":""Shenghua Bao"",""id"":""/profile/81453610810""},{""name"":""Li Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659560680""},{""name"":""Zhong Su"",""id"":""/profile/81453629574""},{""name"":""Yong Yu"",""id"":""/profile/81548005779""}]","[""Amr Ahmed, Bhargav Kanagal, Sandeep Pandey, Vanja Josifovski, Lluis Garcia Pueyo, and Jeffrey Yuan. 2013.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2976737,Learning Informative Priors from Heterogeneous Domains to Improve Recommendation in Cold-Start User Domains,"In the real-world environment, users have sufficient experience in their focused domains but lack experience in other domains. Recommender systems are very helpful for recommending potentially desirable items to users in unfamiliar domains, and cross-domain collaborative filtering is therefore an important emerging research topic. However, it is inevitable that the cold-start issue will be encountered in unfamiliar domains due to the lack of feedback data. The Bayesian approach shows that priors play an important role when there are insufficient data, which implies that recommendation performance can be significantly improved in cold-start domains if informative priors can be provided. Based on this idea, we propose a Weighted Irregular Tensor Factorization (WITF) model to leverage multi-domain feedback data across all users to learn the cross-domain priors w.r.t. both users and items. The features learned from WITF serve as the informative priors on the latent factors of users and items in terms of weighted matrix factorization models. Moreover, WITF is a unified framework for dealing with both explicit feedback and implicit feedback. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we studied three typical real-world cases in which a collection of empirical evaluations were conducted on real-world datasets to compare the performance of our model and other state-of-the-art approaches. The results show the superiority of our model over comparison models.","[{""name"":""Liang Hu"",""id"":""/profile/82658954657""},{""name"":""Longbing Cao"",""id"":""/profile/81451595792""},{""name"":""Jian Cao"",""id"":""/profile/81555988056""},{""name"":""Zhiping Gu"",""id"":""/profile/83458936757""},{""name"":""Guandong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81451595383""},{""name"":""Dingyu Yang"",""id"":""/profile/81555892556""},{""name"":""Liang Hu"",""id"":""/profile/82658954657""},{""name"":""Longbing Cao"",""id"":""/profile/81451595792""},{""name"":""Jian Cao"",""id"":""/profile/81555988056""},{""name"":""Zhiping Gu"",""id"":""/profile/83458936757""},{""name"":""Guandong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81451595383""},{""name"":""Dingyu Yang"",""id"":""/profile/81555892556""}]","[""B.

Motivated by such a desire, this work presents the context tree, a new hierarchical data structure that summarises the context behind user actions in a single model. We propose a method for context tree construction that augments geospatial trajectories with land usage data to identify such contexts. Through evaluation of the construction method and analysis of the properties of generated context trees, we demonstrate the foundation for understanding and modelling behaviour afforded. Summarising user contexts into a single data structure gives easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent, providing the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method for pruning context trees for use in applications where it is desirable to reduce the size of the tree while retaining useful information.","[{""name"":""Alasdair Thomason"",""id"":""/profile/99659078421""},{""name"":""Nathan Griffiths"",""id"":""/profile/81100069617""},{""name"":""Victor Sanchez"",""id"":""/profile/81447595609""},{""name"":""Alasdair Thomason"",""id"":""/profile/99659078421""},{""name"":""Nathan Griffiths"",""id"":""/profile/81100069617""},{""name"":""Victor Sanchez"",""id"":""/profile/81447595609""}]","[""Saif Ahmad, Tugba Taskaya-Temizel, and Khurshid Ahmad. 2004.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2987380,Fast Ranking with Additive Ensembles of Oblivious and Non-Oblivious Regression Trees,"Learning-to-Rank models based on additive ensembles of regression trees have been proven to be very effective for scoring query results returned by large-scale Web search engines. Unfortunately, the computational cost of scoring thousands of candidate documents by traversing large ensembles of trees is high. Thus, several works have investigated solutions aimed at improving the efficiency of document scoring by exploiting advanced features of modern CPUs and memory hierarchies. In this article, we present QuickScorer, a new algorithm that adopts a novel cache-efficient representation of a given tree ensemble, performs an interleaved traversal by means of fast bitwise operations, and supports ensembles of oblivious trees. An extensive and detailed test assessment is conducted on two standard Learning-to-Rank datasets and on a novel very large dataset we made publicly available for conducting significant efficiency tests. The experiments show unprecedented speedups over the best state-of-the-art baselines ranging from 1.9 × to 6.6 × . The analysis of low-level profiling traces shows that QuickScorer efficiency is due to its cache-aware approach in terms of both data layout and access patterns and to a control flow that entails very low branch mis-prediction rates.","[{""name"":""Domenico Dato"",""id"":""/profile/99659094159""},{""name"":""Claudio Lucchese"",""id"":""/profile/81324491771""},{""name"":""Franco Maria Nardini"",""id"":""/profile/81361608198""},{""name"":""Salvatore Orlando"",""id"":""/profile/81100280273""},{""name"":""Raffaele Perego"",""id"":""/profile/81100009930""},{""name"":""Nicola Tonellotto"",""id"":""/profile/81100289293""},{""name"":""Rossano Venturini"",""id"":""/profile/81327492057""},{""name"":""Domenico Dato"",""id"":""/profile/99659094159""},{""name"":""Claudio Lucchese"",""id"":""/profile/81324491771""},{""name"":""Franco Maria Nardini"",""id"":""/profile/81361608198""},{""name"":""Salvatore Orlando"",""id"":""/profile/81100280273""},{""name"":""Raffaele Perego"",""id"":""/profile/81100009930""},{""name"":""Nicola Tonellotto"",""id"":""/profile/81100289293""},{""name"":""Rossano Venturini"",""id"":""/profile/81327492057""}]","[""Nima Asadi, Jimmy Lin, and Arjen P. de Vries. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2988230,Time-Aware Click Model,"Click-through information is considered as a valuable source of users’ implicit relevance feedback for commercial search engines. As existing studies have shown that the search result position in a search engine result page (SERP) has a very strong influence on users’ examination behavior, most existing click models are position based, assuming that users examine results from top to bottom in a linear fashion. Although these click models have been successful, most do not take temporal information into account. As many existing studies have shown, click dwell time and click sequence information are strongly correlated with users’ perceived relevance and search satisfaction. Incorporating temporal information may be important to improve performance of user click models for Web searches. In this article, we investigate the problem of properly incorporating temporal information into click models. We first carry out a laboratory eye-tracking study to analyze users’ examination behavior in different click sequences and find that the user common examination path among adjacent clicks is linear. Next, we analyze the user dwell time distribution in different search logs and find that we cannot simply use a click dwell time threshold (e.g., 30 seconds) to distinguish relevant/irrelevant results. Finally, we propose a novel time-aware click model (TACM), which captures the temporal information of user behavior. We compare the TACM to several existing click models using two real-world search engine logs. Experimental results show that the TACM outperforms other click models in terms of both predicting click behavior (perplexity) and estimating result relevance (NDCG).","[{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Xiaohui Xie"",""id"":""/profile/99659096097""},{""name"":""Chao Wang"",""id"":""/profile/82458612357""},{""name"":""Jian-Yun Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81100564379""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Xiaohui Xie"",""id"":""/profile/99659096097""},{""name"":""Chao Wang"",""id"":""/profile/82458612357""},{""name"":""Jian-Yun Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81100564379""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""}]","[""Eugene Agichtein, Eric Brill, and Susan Dumais. 2006a.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3001583,Hilbert Exclusion: Improved Metric Search through Finite Isometric Embeddings,"Most research into similarity search in metric spaces relies on the triangle inequality property. This property allows the space to be arranged according to relative distances to avoid searching some subspaces. We show that many common metric spaces, notably including those using Euclidean and Jensen-Shannon distances, also have a stronger property, sometimes called the four-point property: In essence, these spaces allow an isometric embedding of any four points in three-dimensional Euclidean space, as well as any three points in two-dimensional Euclidean space. In fact, we show that any space that is isometrically embeddable in Hilbert space has the stronger property. This property gives stronger geometric guarantees, and one in particular, which we name the Hilbert Exclusion property, allows any indexing mechanism which uses hyperplane partitioning to perform better. One outcome of this observation is that a number of state-of-the-art indexing mechanisms over high-dimensional spaces can be easily refined to give a significant increase in performance; furthermore, the improvement given is greater in higher dimensions. This therefore leads to a significant improvement in the cost of metric search in these spaces.","[{""name"":""Richard Connor"",""id"":""/profile/81543824256""},{""name"":""Franco Alberto Cardillo"",""id"":""/profile/99659032705""},{""name"":""Lucia Vadicamo"",""id"":""/profile/99659053053""},{""name"":""Fausto Rabitti"",""id"":""/profile/81100206490""},{""name"":""Richard Connor"",""id"":""/profile/81543824256""},{""name"":""Franco Alberto Cardillo"",""id"":""/profile/99659032705""},{""name"":""Lucia Vadicamo"",""id"":""/profile/99659053053""},{""name"":""Fausto Rabitti"",""id"":""/profile/81100206490""}]","[""Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov, Andre Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, and Mikhail Alekseevich Lavrent’ev. 1999.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3001833,Cost-Effective Online Trending Topic Detection and Popularity Prediction in Microblogging,"Identifying topic trends on microblogging services such as Twitter and estimating those topics’ future popularity have great academic and business value, especially when the operations can be done in real time. For any third party, however, capturing and processing such huge volumes of real-time data in microblogs are almost infeasible tasks, as there always exist API (Application Program Interface) request limits, monitoring and computing budgets, as well as timeliness requirements. To deal with these challenges, we propose a cost-effective system framework with algorithms that can automatically select a subset of representative users in microblogging networks in offline, under given cost constraints. Then the proposed system can online monitor and utilize only these selected users’ real-time microposts to detect the overall trending topics and predict their future popularity among the whole microblogging network. Therefore, our proposed system framework is practical for real-time usage as it avoids the high cost in capturing and processing full real-time data, while not compromising detection and prediction performance under given cost constraints. Experiments with real microblogs dataset show that by tracking only 500 users out of 0.6 million users and processing no more than 30,000 microposts daily, about 92% trending topics could be detected and predicted by the proposed system and, on average, more than 10 hours earlier than they appear in official trends lists.","[{""name"":""Zhongchen Miao"",""id"":""/profile/99659097703""},{""name"":""Kai Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81453623538""},{""name"":""Yi Fang"",""id"":""/profile/84459912857""},{""name"":""Jianhua He"",""id"":""/profile/81100331858""},{""name"":""Yi Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81443594973""},{""name"":""Wenjun Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81323498796""},{""name"":""Hongyuan Zha"",""id"":""/profile/81490670693""},{""name"":""Zhongchen Miao"",""id"":""/profile/99659097703""},{""name"":""Kai Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81453623538""},{""name"":""Yi Fang"",""id"":""/profile/84459912857""},{""name"":""Jianhua He"",""id"":""/profile/81100331858""},{""name"":""Yi Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81443594973""},{""name"":""Wenjun Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81323498796""},{""name"":""Hongyuan Zha"",""id"":""/profile/81490670693""}]","[""Mohamed Ahmed, Stella Spagna, Felipe Huici, and Saverio Niccolini. 2013.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3002172,On Crowdsourcing Relevance Magnitudes for Information Retrieval Evaluation,"Magnitude estimation is a psychophysical scaling technique for the measurement of sensation, where observers assign numbers to stimuli in response to their perceived intensity. We investigate the use of magnitude estimation for judging the relevance of documents for information retrieval evaluation, carrying out a large-scale user study across 18 TREC topics and collecting over 50,000 magnitude estimation judgments using crowdsourcing. Our analysis shows that magnitude estimation judgments can be reliably collected using crowdsourcing, are competitive in terms of assessor cost, and are, on average, rank-aligned with ordinal judgments made by expert relevance assessors.We explore the application of magnitude estimation for IR evaluation, calibrating two gain-based effectiveness metrics, nDCG and ERR, directly from user-reported perceptions of relevance. A comparison of TREC system effectiveness rankings based on binary, ordinal, and magnitude estimation relevance shows substantial variation; in particular, the top systems ranked using magnitude estimation and ordinal judgments differ substantially. Analysis of the magnitude estimation scores shows that this effect is due in part to varying perceptions of relevance: different users have different perceptions of the impact of relative differences in document relevance. These results have direct implications for IR evaluation, suggesting that current assumptions about a single view of relevance being sufficient to represent a population of users are unlikely to hold.","[{""name"":""Eddy Maddalena"",""id"":""/profile/99658682881""},{""name"":""Stefano Mizzaro"",""id"":""/profile/81548023284""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""Andrew Turpin"",""id"":""/profile/81100229960""},{""name"":""Eddy Maddalena"",""id"":""/profile/99658682881""},{""name"":""Stefano Mizzaro"",""id"":""/profile/81548023284""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""Andrew Turpin"",""id"":""/profile/81100229960""}]","[""Omar Alonso and Stefano Mizzaro. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3003725,Targeted Advertising in Public Transportation Systems with Quantitative Evaluation,"In spite of vast business potential, targeted advertising in public transportation systems is a grossly unexplored research area. For instance, SBS Transit in Singapore can reach 1 billion passengers per year but the annual advertising revenue contributes less than $35 million. To bridge the gap, we propose a probabilistic data model that captures the motion patterns and user interests so as to quantitatively evaluate the impact of an advertisement among the passengers. In particular, we leverage hundreds of millions of bus/train boarding transaction records to quantitatively estimate the probability as well as the extent of a user being influenced by an ad. Based on the influence model, we study a top-k retrieval problem for bus/train ad recommendation, which acts as a primitive operator to support various advanced applications. We solve the retrieval problem efficiently to support real-time decision making. In the experimental study, we use the dataset from SBS Transit as a case study to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodologies.","[{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Long Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99658655755""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Jie Shao"",""id"":""/profile/99658657167""},{""name"":""Sai Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81503688718""},{""name"":""Heng Tao Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81375593454""},{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Long Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99658655755""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Jie Shao"",""id"":""/profile/99658657167""},{""name"":""Sai Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81503688718""},{""name"":""Heng Tao Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81375593454""}]","[""Luis Otavio Alvares, Vania Bogorny, Bart Kuijpers, Jose Antonio Fernandes de Macedo, Bart Moelans, and Alejandro Vaisman. 2007.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2975590,Re-Finding Behaviour in Vertical Domains,"Re-finding is the process of searching for information that a user has previously encountered and is a common activity carried out with information retrieval systems. In this work, we investigate re-finding in the context of vertical search, differentiating and modeling user re-finding behavior within different media and topic domains, including images, news, reference material, and movies. We distinguish the re-finding behavior in vertical domains from re-finding in a general search context and engineer features that are effective in differentiating re-finding across the domains. The features are then used to build machine-learned models, achieving an accuracy of re-finding detection in verticals of 85.7% on average. Our results demonstrate that detecting re-finding in specific verticals is more difficult than examining re-finding for general search tasks. We then investigate the effectiveness of differentiating re-finding behavior in two restricted contexts: We consider the case where the history of a searcher’s interactions with the search system is not available. In this scenario, our features and models achieve an average accuracy of 77.5% across the domains. We then examine the detection of re-finding during the early part of a search session. Both of these restrictions represent potential real-world search scenarios, where a system is attempting to learn about a user but may have limited information available. Finally, we investigate in which types of domains re-finding is most difficult. Here, it would appear that re-finding images is particularly challenging for users. This research has implications for search engine design, in terms of adapting search results by predicting the type of user tasks and potentially enabling the presentation of vertical-specific results when re-finding is identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the issue of vertical re-finding.","[{""name"":""Seyedeh Sargol Sadeghi"",""id"":""/profile/81440613020""},{""name"":""Roi Blanco"",""id"":""/profile/81100367648""},{""name"":""Peter Mika"",""id"":""/profile/81100153368""},{""name"":""Mark Sanderson"",""id"":""/profile/81100454785""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""David Vallet"",""id"":""/profile/81503659397""},{""name"":""Seyedeh Sargol Sadeghi"",""id"":""/profile/81440613020""},{""name"":""Roi Blanco"",""id"":""/profile/81100367648""},{""name"":""Peter Mika"",""id"":""/profile/81100153368""},{""name"":""Mark Sanderson"",""id"":""/profile/81100454785""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""David Vallet"",""id"":""/profile/81503659397""}]","[""Mikhail Ageev, Qi Guo, Dmitry Lagun, and Eugene Agichtein. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3007186,Inverted Treaps,"We introduce a new representation of the inverted index that performs faster ranked unions and intersections while using similar space. Our index is based on the treap data structure, which allows us to intersect/merge the document identifiers while simultaneously thresholding by frequency, instead of the costlier two-step classical processing methods. To achieve compression, we represent the treap topology using different alternative compact data structures. Further, the treap invariants allow us to elegantly encode differentially both document identifiers and frequencies. We also show how to extend this representation to support incremental updates over the index. Results show that, under the tf-idf scoring scheme, our index uses about the same space as state-of-the-art compact representations, while performing up to 2--20 times faster on ranked single-word, union, or intersection queries. Under the BM25 scoring scheme, our index may use up to 40% more space than the others and outperforms them less frequently but still reaches improvement factors of 2--20 in the best cases. The index supporting incremental updates poses an overhead of 50%--100% over the static variants in terms of space, construction, and query time.","[{""name"":""Roberto Konow"",""id"":""/profile/81440617651""},{""name"":""Gonzalo Navarro"",""id"":""/profile/81100113887""},{""name"":""Charles L.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3015466,Search Result Prefetching on Desktop and Mobile,"Search result examination is an important part of searching. High page load latency for landing pages (clicked search results) can reduce the efficiency of the search process. Proactively prefetching landing pages in advance of clickthrough can save searchers valuable time. However, prefetching consumes resources (primarily bandwidth and battery) that are wasted unless the prefetched results are requested by searchers. Balancing the costs in prefetching particular results against the benefits in reduced latency to searchers represents the search result prefetching challenge. In this article, we introduce this challenge and present methods to address it in both desktop and mobile settings. Our methods leverage searchers’ cursor movements (on desktop) and viewport-based viewing behavior (on mobile) on search engine result pages (SERPs) in real time to dynamically estimate the result that searchers will request next. We demonstrate through large-scale log analysis that our approach significantly outperforms three strong baselines that prefetch results based on (i) the search engine result ranking (prefetch top-ranked results), (ii) past SERP clicks from all searchers for the query (prefetch popular results), or (iii) past SERP clicks from the current searcher for the query (prefetch results that the searcher prefers). Our promising findings have implications for the design of search support in desktop and mobile settings that makes the search process more efficient.","[{""name"":""Ryen W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3052768,Incorporating User Expectations and Behavior into the Measurement of Search Effectiveness,"Information retrieval systems aim to help users satisfy information needs. We argue that the goal of the person using the system, and the pattern of behavior that they exhibit as they proceed to attain that goal, should be incorporated into the methods and techniques used to evaluate the effectiveness of IR systems, so that the resulting effectiveness scores have a useful interpretation that corresponds to the users’ search experience. In particular, we investigate the role of search task complexity, and show that it has a direct bearing on the number of relevant answer documents sought by users in response to an information need, suggesting that useful effectiveness metrics must be goal sensitive. We further suggest that user behavior while scanning results listings is affected by the rate at which their goal is being realized, and hence that appropriate effectiveness metrics must be adaptive to the presence (or not) of relevant documents in the ranking. In response to these two observations, we present a new effectiveness metric, INST, that has both of the desired properties: INST employs a parameter T, a direct measure of the user’s search goal that adjusts the top-weightedness of the evaluation score; moreover, as progress towards the target T is made, the modeled user behavior is adapted, to reflect the remaining expectations. INST is experimentally compared to previous effectiveness metrics, including Average Precision (AP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Rank-Biased Precision (RBP), demonstrating our claims as to INST’s usefulness. Like RBP, INST is a weighted-precision metric, meaning that each score can be accompanied by a residual that quantifies the extent of the score uncertainty caused by unjudged documents. As part of our experimentation, we use crowd-sourced data and score residuals to demonstrate that a wide range of queries arise for even quite specific information needs, and that these variant queries introduce significant levels of residual uncertainty into typical experimental evaluations. These causes of variability have wide-reaching implications for experiment design, and for the construction of test collections.","[{""name"":""Alistair Moffat"",""id"":""/profile/81100200925""},{""name"":""Peter Bailey"",""id"":""/profile/81405594971""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""Paul Thomas"",""id"":""/profile/81100409727""},{""name"":""Alistair Moffat"",""id"":""/profile/81100200925""},{""name"":""Peter Bailey"",""id"":""/profile/81405594971""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""Paul Thomas"",""id"":""/profile/81100409727""}]","[""N.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3052769,Improving the Quality of Recommendations for Users and Items in the Tail of Distribution,"Short-head and long-tail distributed data are widely observed in the real world. The same is true of recommender systems (RSs), where a small number of popular items dominate the choices and feedback data while the rest only account for a small amount of feedback. As a result, most RS methods tend to learn user preferences from popular items since they account for most data. However, recent research in e-commerce and marketing has shown that future businesses will obtain greater profit from long-tail selling. Yet, although the number of long-tail items and users is much larger than that of short-head items and users, in reality, the amount of data associated with long-tail items and users is much less. As a result, user preferences tend to be popularity-biased. Furthermore, insufficient data makes long-tail items and users more vulnerable to shilling attack. To improve the quality of recommendations for items and users in the tail of distribution, we propose a coupled regularization approach that consists of two latent factor models: C-HMF, for enhancing credibility, and S-HMF, for emphasizing specialty on user choices. Specifically, the estimates learned from C-HMF and S-HMF recurrently serve as the empirical priors to regularize one another. Such coupled regularization leads to the comprehensive effects of final estimates, which produce more qualitative predictions for both tail users and tail items. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct empirical evaluations on large real-world datasets with various metrics. The results prove that our approach significantly outperforms the compared methods.","[{""name"":""Liang Hu"",""id"":""/profile/82658954657""},{""name"":""Longbing Cao"",""id"":""/profile/99659079573""},{""name"":""Jian Cao"",""id"":""/profile/81555988056""},{""name"":""Zhiping Gu"",""id"":""/profile/83458936757""},{""name"":""Guandong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81451595383""},{""name"":""Jie Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81350589062""},{""name"":""Liang Hu"",""id"":""/profile/82658954657""},{""name"":""Longbing Cao"",""id"":""/profile/99659079573""},{""name"":""Jian Cao"",""id"":""/profile/81555988056""},{""name"":""Zhiping Gu"",""id"":""/profile/83458936757""},{""name"":""Guandong Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81451595383""},{""name"":""Jie Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81350589062""}]","[""E.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3052770,Encoding Syntactic Knowledge in Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification,"Phrase/Sentence representation is one of the most important problems in natural language processing. Many neural network models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recursive Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been proposed to learn representations of phrase/sentence, however, rich syntactic knowledge has not been fully explored when composing a longer text from its shorter constituent words. In most traditional models, only word embeddings are utilized to compose phrase/sentence representations, while the syntactic information of words is yet to be explored. In this article, we discover that encoding syntactic knowledge (part-of-speech tag) in neural networks can enhance sentence/phrase representation. Specifically, we propose to learn tag-specific composition functions and tag embeddings in recursive neural networks, and propose to utilize POS tags to control the gates of tree-structured LSTM networks. We evaluate these models on two benchmark datasets for sentiment classification, and demonstrate that improvements can be obtained with such syntactic knowledge encoded.","[{""name"":""Minlie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81430592684""},{""name"":""Qiao Qian"",""id"":""/profile/99658656805""},{""name"":""Xiaoyan Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81438595316""},{""name"":""Minlie Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81430592684""},{""name"":""Qiao Qian"",""id"":""/profile/99658656805""},{""name"":""Xiaoyan Zhu"",""id"":""/profile/81438595316""}]","[""Frédéric Bastien, Pascal Lamblin, Razvan Pascanu, James Bergstra, Ian J.

In terms of compact indexing, we categorize the keywords into rare terms and common terms based on inverse document frequency (idf) and propose tailored block-oriented organization to save memory consumption. In terms of fast searching, we classify the queries into three types based on term category and judiciously design an efficient search algorithm for each type. We conducted extensive experiments on a billion-scale Twitter dataset and examined the performance with both simple and more advanced ranking functions. The results showed that with much smaller index size, our search algorithm achieves a factor of 2--3 times faster speedup over state-of-the-art solutions in both ranking scenarios.","[{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Huanbo Luan"",""id"":""/profile/81361599426""},{""name"":""Kian-Lee Tan"",""id"":""/profile/81502695037""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Heng Tao Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81375593454""},{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Huanbo Luan"",""id"":""/profile/81361599426""},{""name"":""Kian-Lee Tan"",""id"":""/profile/81502695037""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Heng Tao Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81375593454""}]","[""Vo Ngoc Anh, Owen de Kretser, and Alistair Moffat. 2001.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3052772,Processing Long Queries Against Short Text: Top-k Advertisement Matching in News Stream Applications,"Many real applications in real-time news stream advertising call for efficient processing of long queries against short text. In such applications, dynamic news feeds are regarded as queries to match against an advertisement (ad) database for retrieving the k most relevant ads. The existing approaches to keyword retrieval cannot work well in this search scenario when queries are triggered at a very high frequency. To address the problem, we introduce new techniques to significantly improve search performance. First, we devise a two-level partitioning for tight upper bound estimation and a lazy evaluation scheme to delay full evaluation of unpromising candidates, which can bring three to four times performance boosting in a database with 7 million ads. Second, we propose a novel rank-aware block-oriented inverted index to further improve performance. In this index scheme, each entry in an inverted list is assigned a rank according to its importance in the ad. Then, we introduce a block-at-a-time search strategy based on the index scheme to support a much tighter upper bound estimation and a very early termination. We have conducted experiments with real datasets, and the results show that the rank-aware method can further improve performance by an order of magnitude.","[{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Yuchen Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658725921""},{""name"":""Ju Fan"",""id"":""/profile/81387593229""},{""name"":""Lianli Gao"",""id"":""/profile/99658725783""},{""name"":""Fumin Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81501649871""},{""name"":""Heng Tao Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81375593454""},{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Yuchen Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658725921""},{""name"":""Ju Fan"",""id"":""/profile/81387593229""},{""name"":""Lianli Gao"",""id"":""/profile/99658725783""},{""name"":""Fumin Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81501649871""},{""name"":""Heng Tao Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81375593454""}]","[""Vo Ngoc Anh, Owen de Kretser, and Alistair Moffat. 2001.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086665,"Search, Mining, and Their Applications on Mobile Devices: Introduction to the Special Issue","In recent years, mobile devices have become the most popular interface for users to retrieve and access information: recent reports show that users spend significantly more time and issue more search queries on mobile devices than on desktops in the United States.1 The accelerated growth of mobile usage brings unique opportunities to the information retrieval and data mining research communities.Mobile devices capture rich contextual and personal signals that can be leveraged to accurately predict users’ intent for serving more relevant content and can even proactively provide novel zero-query recommendations. Apple Siri, Google Now, and Microsoft Cortana are recent examples of such emerging systems. Furthermore, mobile devices constantly generate a huge amount of sensor footprints (e.g., GPS, motion sensors) and user activity data (e.g., used apps) that are often missing from their desktop counterparts. These new sources of implicit and explicit user feedback are valuable for discovering actionable knowledge, and designing better systems that serve each individual the right content at the right time and location. In addition, by aggregating mobile interactions across individuals, one can infer interesting conclusions beyond search and recommendation. Generating real-time traffic estimates is one example of such applications.This special issue focuses on research problems of search, mining, and their applications in mobile devices. Topics of interest in this special issue include but are not limited to mobile data mining and management, mobile search, personalization and recommendation, mobile user interfaces and human-computer interaction, and new applications in the mobile environment. The aim of this special issue is to bring together top experts across multiple disciplines, including information retrieval, data mining, mobile computing, and cyberphysical systems, such that academic and industrial researchers can exchange ideas and share the latest developments on the state of the art and practice of mobile search and mobile data mining.","[{""name"":""Hongning Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81466648782""},{""name"":""Rui Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659193214""},{""name"":""Milad Shokouhi"",""id"":""/profile/81508689276""},{""name"":""Hang Li"",""id"":""/profile/81350598903""},{""name"":""Yi Chang"",""id"":""/profile/81350595185""},{""name"":""Hongning Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81466648782""},{""name"":""Rui Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659193214""},{""name"":""Milad Shokouhi"",""id"":""/profile/81508689276""},{""name"":""Hang Li"",""id"":""/profile/81350598903""},{""name"":""Yi Chang"",""id"":""/profile/81350595185""}]","[""Olga Arkhipova and Lidia Grauer. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3041659,Collaborative Intent Prediction with Real-Time Contextual Data,"Intelligent personal assistants on mobile devices such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Cortana are increasingly important. Instead of passively reacting to queries, they provide users with brand new proactive experiences that aim to offer the right information at the right time. It is, therefore, crucial for personal assistants to understand users’ intent, that is, what information users need now. Intent is closely related to context. Various contextual signals, including spatio-temporal information and users’ activities, can signify users’ intent. It is, however, challenging to model the correlation between intent and context. Intent and context are highly dynamic and often sequentially correlated. Contextual signals are usually sparse, heterogeneous, and not simultaneously available. We propose an innovative collaborative nowcasting model to jointly address all these issues. The model effectively addresses the complex sequential and concurring correlation between context and intent and recognizes users’ real-time intent with continuously arrived contextual signals. We extensively evaluate the proposed model with real-world data sets from a commercial personal assistant. The results validate the effectiveness the proposed model, and demonstrate its capability of handling the real-time flow of contextual signals. The studied problem and model also provide inspiring implications for new paradigms of recommendation on mobile intelligent devices.","[{""name"":""Yu Sun"",""id"":""/profile/99659005280""},{""name"":""Nicholas Jing Yuan"",""id"":""/profile/82458762557""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Kieran McDonald"",""id"":""/profile/99659004658""},{""name"":""Rui Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81435596120""},{""name"":""Yu Sun"",""id"":""/profile/99659005280""},{""name"":""Nicholas Jing Yuan"",""id"":""/profile/82458762557""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Kieran McDonald"",""id"":""/profile/99659004658""},{""name"":""Rui Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81435596120""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3057283,A Time-Aware Personalized Point-of-Interest Recommendation via High-Order Tensor Factorization,"Recently, location-based services (LBSs) have been increasingly popular for people to experience new possibilities, for example, personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendations that leverage on the overlapping of user trajectories to recommend POI collaboratively. POI recommendation is yet challenging as it suffers from the problems known for the conventional recommendation tasks such as data sparsity and cold start, and to a much greater extent. In the literature, most of the related works apply collaborate filtering to POI recommendation while overlooking the personalized time-variant human behavioral tendency. In this article, we put forward a fourth-order tensor factorization-based ranking methodology to recommend users their interested locations by considering their time-varying behavioral trends while capturing their long-term preferences and short-term preferences simultaneously. We also propose to categorize the locations to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start issues, and accordingly new POIs that users have not visited can thus be bubbled up during the category ranking process. The tensor factorization is carefully studied to prune the irrelevant factors to the ranking results to achieve efficient POI recommendations. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed mechanism, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly.","[{""name"":""Xin Li"",""id"":""/profile/81416609442""},{""name"":""Mingming Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/99659185169""},{""name"":""Huiting Hong"",""id"":""/profile/99659184020""},{""name"":""Lejian Liao"",""id"":""/profile/81339513628""},{""name"":""Xin Li"",""id"":""/profile/81416609442""},{""name"":""Mingming Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/99659185169""},{""name"":""Huiting Hong"",""id"":""/profile/99659184020""},{""name"":""Lejian Liao"",""id"":""/profile/81339513628""}]","[""Jie Bao, Yu Zheng, and Mohamed F.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3072588,Mining Exploratory Behavior to Improve Mobile App Recommendations,"With the widespread usage of smart phones, more and more mobile apps are developed every day, playing an increasingly important role in changing our lifestyles and business models. In this trend, it becomes a hot research topic for developing effective mobile app recommender systems in both industry and academia. Compared with existing studies about mobile app recommendations, our research aims to improve the recommendation effectiveness based on analyzing a psychological trait of human beings, exploratory behavior, which refers to a type of variety-seeking behavior in unfamiliar domains. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic model named Goal-oriented Exploratory Model (GEM), integrating exploratory behavior identification with personalized item recommendation. An algorithm combining collapsed Gibbs sampling and Expectation Maximization is developed for model learning and inference. Through extensive experiments conducted on a real dataset, the proposed model demonstrates superior recommendation performances and good interpretability compared with state-of-art recommendation methods. Moreover, empirical analyses on exploratory behavior find that individuals with a strong exploratory tendency exhibit behavioral patterns of variety seeking, risk taking, and higher involvement. Besides, mobile apps that are less popular or in the long tail possess greater potential of arousing exploratory behavior in individuals.","[{""name"":""Jiangning He"",""id"":""/profile/99659157836""},{""name"":""Hongyan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81456625293""},{""name"":""Jiangning He"",""id"":""/profile/99659157836""},{""name"":""Hongyan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81456625293""}]","[""Hans Baumgartner and Jan Benedict E.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086686,"Curious Cat--Mobile, Context-Aware Conversational Crowdsourcing Knowledge Acquisition","Scaled acquisition of high-quality structured knowledge has been a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence research. Recent advances in crowdsourcing, the sheer number of Internet and mobile users, and the commercial availability of supporting platforms offer new tools for knowledge acquisition. This article applies context-aware knowledge acquisition that simultaneously satisfies users’ immediate information needs while extending its own knowledge using crowdsourcing. The focus is on knowledge acquisition on a mobile device, which makes the approach practical and scalable; in this context, we propose and implement a new KA approach that exploits an existing knowledge base to drive the KA process, communicate with the right people, and check for consistency of the user-provided answers. We tested the viability of the approach in experiments using our platform with real users around the world, and an existing large source of common-sense background knowledge. These experiments show that the approach is promising: the knowledge is estimated to be true and useful for users 95% of the time. Using context to proactively drive knowledge acquisition increased engagement and effectiveness (the number of new assertions/day/user increased for 175%). Using pre-existing and newly acquired knowledge also proved beneficial.","[{""name"":""Luka Bradeško"",""id"":""/profile/81485659135""},{""name"":""Michael Witbrock"",""id"":""/profile/81100208880""},{""name"":""Janez Starc"",""id"":""/profile/99658716402""},{""name"":""Zala Herga"",""id"":""/profile/99659523662""},{""name"":""Marko Grobelnik"",""id"":""/profile/81100130232""},{""name"":""Dunja Mladenić"",""id"":""/profile/81100214470""},{""name"":""Luka Bradeško"",""id"":""/profile/81485659135""},{""name"":""Michael Witbrock"",""id"":""/profile/81100208880""},{""name"":""Janez Starc"",""id"":""/profile/99658716402""},{""name"":""Zala Herga"",""id"":""/profile/99659523662""},{""name"":""Marko Grobelnik"",""id"":""/profile/81100130232""},{""name"":""Dunja Mladenić"",""id"":""/profile/81100214470""}]","[""D.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3091107,Search by Screenshots for Universal Article Clipping in Mobile Apps,"To address the difficulty in clipping articles from various mobile applications (apps), we propose a novel framework called UniClip, which allows a user to snap a screen of an article to save the whole article in one place. The key task of the framework is search by screenshots, which has three challenges: (1) how to represent a screenshot; (2) how to formulate queries for effective article retrieval; and (3) how to identify the article from search results. We solve these by (1) segmenting a screenshot into structural units called blocks, (2) formulating effective search queries by considering the role of each block, and (3) aggregating the search result lists of multiple queries. To improve efficiency, we also extend our approach with learning-to-rank techniques so that we can find the desired article with only one query. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high retrieval performance (F1 = 0.868), which outperforms baselines based on keyword extraction and chunking methods. Learning-to-rank models improve our approach without learning by about 6%. A user study conducted to investigate the usability of UniClip reveals that ours is preferred by 21 out of 22 participants for its simplicity and effectiveness.","[{""name"":""Kazutoshi Umemoto"",""id"":""/profile/81502666425""},{""name"":""Ruihua Song"",""id"":""/profile/81100578631""},{""name"":""Jian-Yun Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81100564379""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Katsumi Tanaka"",""id"":""/profile/86058923157""},{""name"":""Yong Rui"",""id"":""/profile/81322505341""},{""name"":""Kazutoshi Umemoto"",""id"":""/profile/81502666425""},{""name"":""Ruihua Song"",""id"":""/profile/81100578631""},{""name"":""Jian-Yun Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81100564379""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Katsumi Tanaka"",""id"":""/profile/86058923157""},{""name"":""Yong Rui"",""id"":""/profile/81322505341""}]","[""Mikhail Ageev, Qi Guo, Dmitry Lagun, and Eugene Agichtein. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3057278,User Modeling on Demographic Attributes in Big Mobile Social Networks,"Users with demographic profiles in social networks offer the potential to understand the social principles that underpin our highly connected world, from individuals, to groups, to societies. In this article, we harness the power of network and data sciences to model the interplay between user demographics and social behavior and further study to what extent users’ demographic profiles can be inferred from their mobile communication patterns. By modeling over 7 million users and 1 billion mobile communication records, we find that during the active dating period (i.e., 18--35 years old), users are active in broadening social connections with males and females alike, while after reaching 35 years of age people tend to keep small, closed, and same-gender social circles. Further, we formalize the demographic prediction problem of inferring users’ gender and age simultaneously. We propose a factor graph-based WhoAmI method to address the problem by leveraging not only the correlations between network features and users’ gender/age, but also the interrelations between gender and age. In addition, we identify a new problem—coupled network demographic prediction across multiple mobile operators—and present a coupled variant of the WhoAmI method to address its unique challenges. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and applicability of the WhoAmI methods. Finally, our study finds a greater than 80% potential predictability for inferring users’ gender from phone call behavior and 73% for users’ age from text messaging interactions.","[{""name"":""Yuxiao Dong"",""id"":""/profile/81556305356""},{""name"":""Nitesh V.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3041658,A Neural Network Approach to Jointly Modeling Social Networks and Mobile Trajectories,"Two characteristics of location-based services are mobile trajectories and the ability to facilitate social networking. The recording of trajectory data contributes valuable resources towards understanding users’ geographical movement behaviors. Social networking is possible when users are able to quickly connect to anyone nearby. A social network with location based services is known as location-based social network (LBSN). As shown in Cho et al. [2013], locations that are frequently visited by socially related persons tend to be correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. To better analyze and mine LBSN data, we need to have a comprehensive view of each of these two aspects, i.e., the mobile trajectory data and the social network.Specifically, we present a novel neural network model that can jointly model both social networks and mobile trajectories. Our model consists of two components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile trajectories. First we adopt a network embedding method for the construction of social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key to our model lies in generating mobile trajectories. Second, we consider four factors that influence the generation process of mobile trajectories: user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term sequential contexts, and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential relatedness in mobile trajectories at the short or long term levels. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In particular, the improvement over baselines is more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.","[{""name"":""Cheng Yang"",""id"":""/profile/99658753248""},{""name"":""Maosong Sun"",""id"":""/profile/81327491947""},{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Zhiyuan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81418597384""},{""name"":""Edward Y.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3017429,Cross-Platform App Recommendation by Jointly Modeling Ratings and Texts,"Over the last decade, the renaissance of Web technologies has transformed the online world into an application (App) driven society. While the abundant Apps have provided great convenience, their sheer number also leads to severe information overload, making it difficult for users to identify desired Apps. To alleviate the information overloading issue, recommender systems have been proposed and deployed for the App domain. However, existing work on App recommendation has largely focused on one single platform (e.g., smartphones), while it ignores the rich data of other relevant platforms (e.g., tablets and computers).In this article, we tackle the problem of cross-platform App recommendation, aiming at leveraging users’ and Apps’ data on multiple platforms to enhance the recommendation accuracy. The key advantage of our proposal is that by leveraging multiplatform data, the perpetual issues in personalized recommender systems—data sparsity and cold-start—can be largely alleviated. To this end, we propose a hybrid solution, STAR (short for “croSs-plaTform App Recommendation”) that integrates both numerical ratings and textual content from multiple platforms. In STAR, we innovatively represent an App as an aggregation of common features across platforms (e.g., App’s functionalities) and specific features that are dependent on the resided platform. In light of this, STAR can discriminate a user’s preference on an App by separating the user’s interest into two parts (either in the App’s inherent factors or platform-aware features). To evaluate our proposal, we construct two real-world datasets that are crawled from the App stores of iPhone, iPad, and iMac. Through extensive experiments, we show that our STAR method consistently outperforms highly competitive recommendation methods, justifying the rationality of our cross-platform App recommendation proposal and the effectiveness of our solution.","[{""name"":""Da Cao"",""id"":""/profile/99659109562""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Xiaochi Wei"",""id"":""/profile/83458651357""},{""name"":""Xia Hu"",""id"":""/profile/81453623389""},{""name"":""Shunxiang Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81387600649""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Da Cao"",""id"":""/profile/99659109562""},{""name"":""Xiangnan He"",""id"":""/profile/87658767957""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Xiaochi Wei"",""id"":""/profile/83458651357""},{""name"":""Xia Hu"",""id"":""/profile/81453623389""},{""name"":""Shunxiang Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81387600649""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius, Ramesh Sankaranarayanan, Shahana Sen, and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3015458,Version-Aware Rating Prediction for Mobile App Recommendation,"With the great popularity of mobile devices, the amount of mobile apps has grown at a more dramatic rate than ever expected. A technical challenge is how to recommend suitable apps to mobile users. In this work, we identify and focus on a unique characteristic that exists in mobile app recommendation—that is, an app usually corresponds to multiple release versions. Based on this characteristic, we propose a fine-grain version-aware app recommendation problem. Instead of directly learning the users’ preferences over the apps, we aim to infer the ratings of users on a specific version of an app. However, the user-version rating matrix will be sparser than the corresponding user-app rating matrix, making existing recommendation methods less effective. In view of this, our approach has made two major extensions. First, we leverage the review text that is associated with each rating record; more importantly, we consider two types of version-based correlations. The first type is to capture the temporal correlations between multiple versions within the same app, and the second type of correlation is to capture the aggregation correlations between similar apps. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several competitive methods.","[{""name"":""Yuan Yao"",""id"":""/profile/81444603232""},{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Yaojing Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659524627""},{""name"":""Hanghang Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81337494052""},{""name"":""Feng Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81423594689""},{""name"":""Jian Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81435606125""},{""name"":""Yuan Yao"",""id"":""/profile/81444603232""},{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Yaojing Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659524627""},{""name"":""Hanghang Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81337494052""},{""name"":""Feng Xu"",""id"":""/profile/81423594689""},{""name"":""Jian Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81435606125""}]","[""Deepak Agarwal and Bee-Chung Chen. 2009.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3015462,Deriving User Preferences of Mobile Apps from Their Management Activities,"App marketplaces host millions of mobile apps that are downloaded billions of times. Investigating how people manage mobile apps in their everyday lives creates a unique opportunity to understand the behavior and preferences of mobile device users, infer the quality of apps, and improve user experience. Existing literature provides very limited knowledge about app management activities, due to the lack of app usage data at scale. This article takes the initiative to analyze a very large app management log collected through a leading Android app marketplace. The dataset covers 5 months of detailed downloading, updating, and uninstallation activities, which involve 17 million anonymized users and 1 million apps. We present a surprising finding that the metrics commonly used to rank apps in app stores do not truly reflect the users’ real attitudes. We then identify behavioral patterns from the app management activities that more accurately indicate user preferences of an app even when no explicit rating is available. A systematic statistical analysis is designed to evaluate machine learning models that are trained to predict user preferences using these behavioral patterns, which features an inverse probability weighting method to correct the selection biases in the training process.","[{""name"":""Xuanzhe Liu"",""id"":""/profile/84459152157""},{""name"":""Wei Ai"",""id"":""/profile/99658719634""},{""name"":""Huoran Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658719039""},{""name"":""Jian Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81100641298""},{""name"":""Gang Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81350600064""},{""name"":""Feng Feng"",""id"":""/profile/99658716948""},{""name"":""Qiaozhu Mei"",""id"":""/profile/81100214997""},{""name"":""Xuanzhe Liu"",""id"":""/profile/84459152157""},{""name"":""Wei Ai"",""id"":""/profile/99658719634""},{""name"":""Huoran Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658719039""},{""name"":""Jian Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81100641298""},{""name"":""Gang Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81350600064""},{""name"":""Feng Feng"",""id"":""/profile/99658716948""},{""name"":""Qiaozhu Mei"",""id"":""/profile/81100214997""}]","[""Sharad Agarwal, Ratul Mahajan, Alice Zheng, and Victor Bahl. 2010.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3057281,Computing Urban Traffic Congestions by Incorporating Sparse GPS Probe Data and Social Media Data,"Estimating urban traffic conditions of an arterial network with GPS probe data is a practically important while substantially challenging problem, and has attracted increasing research interests recently. Although GPS probe data is becoming a ubiquitous data source for various traffic related applications currently, they are usually insufficient for fully estimating traffic conditions of a large arterial network due to the low sampling frequency. To explore other data sources for more effectively computing urban traffic conditions, we propose to collect various traffic events such as traffic accident and jam from social media as complementary information. In addition, to further explore other factors that might affect traffic conditions, we also extract rich auxiliary information including social events, road features, Point of Interest (POI), and weather. With the enriched traffic data and auxiliary information collected from different sources, we first study the traffic co-congestion pattern mining problem with the aim of discovering which road segments geographically close to each other are likely to co-occur traffic congestion. A search tree based approach is proposed to efficiently discover the co-congestion patterns. These patterns are then used to help estimate traffic congestions and detect anomalies in a transportation network. To fuse the multisourced data, we finally propose a coupled matrix and tensor factorization model named TCE_R to more accurately complete the sparse traffic congestion matrix by collaboratively factorizing it with other matrices and tensors formed by other data.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3057280,DeepMob: Learning Deep Knowledge of Human Emergency Behavior and Mobility from Big and Heterogeneous Data,"The frequency and intensity of natural disasters has increased significantly in recent decades, and this trend is expected to continue. Hence, understanding and predicting human evacuation behavior and mobility will play a vital role in planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, existing models are shallow models, and it is difficult to apply them for understanding the “deep knowledge” of human mobility. Therefore, in this study, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g., GPS records of 1.6 million users over 3 years, data on earthquakes that have occurred in Japan over 4 years, news report data, and transportation network data), and we build an intelligent system, namely, DeepMob, for understanding and predicting human evacuation behavior and mobility following different types of natural disasters. The key component of DeepMob is based on a deep learning architecture that aims to understand the basic laws that govern human behavior and mobility following natural disasters, from big and heterogeneous data. Furthermore, based on the deep learning model, DeepMob can accurately predict or simulate a person’s future evacuation behaviors or evacuation routes under different disaster conditions. Experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our system, and suggest that human mobility following disasters may be predicted and simulated more easily than previously thought.","[{""name"":""Xuan Song"",""id"":""/profile/81548266356""},{""name"":""Ryosuke Shibasaki"",""id"":""/profile/81100609541""},{""name"":""Nicholos Jing Yuan"",""id"":""/profile/82458762557""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Tao Li"",""id"":""/profile/81100475528""},{""name"":""Ryutaro Adachi"",""id"":""/profile/99658752920""},{""name"":""Xuan Song"",""id"":""/profile/81548266356""},{""name"":""Ryosuke Shibasaki"",""id"":""/profile/81100609541""},{""name"":""Nicholos Jing Yuan"",""id"":""/profile/82458762557""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Tao Li"",""id"":""/profile/81100475528""},{""name"":""Ryutaro Adachi"",""id"":""/profile/99658752920""}]","[""Lars Backstrom, Eric Sun, and Cameron Marlow. 2010.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086676,Tweet Can Be Fit: Integrating Data from Wearable Sensors and Multiple Social Networks for Wellness Profile Learning,"Wellness is a widely popular concept that is commonly applied to fitness and self-help products or services. Inference of personal wellness--related attributes, such as body mass index (BMI) category or disease tendency, as well as understanding of global dependencies between wellness attributes and users’ behavior, is of crucial importance to various applications in personal and public wellness domains. At the same time, the emergence of social media platforms and wearable sensors makes it feasible to perform wellness profiling for users from multiple perspectives. However, research efforts on wellness profiling and integration of social media and sensor data are relatively sparse. This study represents one of the first attempts in this direction. Specifically, we infer personal wellness attributes by utilizing our proposed multisource multitask wellness profile learning framework—WellMTL—which can handle data incompleteness and perform wellness attributes inference from sensor and social media data simultaneously. To gain insights into the data at a global level, we also examine correlations between first-order data representations and personal wellness attributes. Our experimental results show that the integration of sensor data and multiple social media sources can substantially boost the performance of individual wellness profiling.","[{""name"":""Aleksandr Farseev"",""id"":""/profile/99658727991""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Aleksandr Farseev"",""id"":""/profile/99658727991""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""}]","[""Sofiane Abbar, Yelena Mejova, and Ingmar Weber. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086677,Understanding the Purpose of Permission Use in Mobile Apps,"Mobile apps frequently request access to sensitive data, such as location and contacts. Understanding the purpose of why sensitive data is accessed could help improve privacy as well as enable new kinds of access control. In this article, we propose a text mining based method to infer the purpose of sensitive data access by Android apps. The key idea we propose is to extract multiple features from app code and then use those features to train a machine learning classifier for purpose inference. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of two complementary approaches to infer the purpose of permission use, first using purely static analysis, and then using primarily dynamic analysis. We also discuss the pros and cons of both approaches and the trade-offs involved.","[{""name"":""Haoyu Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659151059""},{""name"":""Yuanchun Li"",""id"":""/profile/99659070771""},{""name"":""Yao Guo"",""id"":""/profile/81331493766""},{""name"":""Yuvraj Agarwal"",""id"":""/profile/81310499248""},{""name"":""Jason I.
