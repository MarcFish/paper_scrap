https://doi.org/10.1145/2751557,Identifying Opportunities for Valuable Encounters: Toward Context-Aware Social Matching Systems,"Mobile social matching systems have the potential to transform the way we make new social ties, but only if we are able to overcome the many challenges that exist as to how systems can utilize contextual data to recommend interesting and relevant people to users and facilitate valuable encounters between strangers. This article outlines how context and mobility influence people's motivations to meet new people and presents innovative design concepts for mediating mobile encounters through context-aware social matching systems. Findings from two studies are presented. The first, a survey study (n = 117) explored the concept of contextual rarity of shared user attributes as a measure to improve desirability in mobile social matches. The second, an interview study (n = 58) explored people's motivations to meet others in various contexts. From these studies we derived a set of novel context-aware social matching concepts, including contextual sociability and familiarity as an indicator of opportune social context; contextual engagement as an indicator of opportune personal context; and contextual rarity, oddity, and activity partnering as an indicator of opportune relational context. The findings of these studies establish the importance of different contextual factors and frame the design space of context-aware social matching systems.","[{""name"":""Julia M.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2749459,Latent Discriminative Models for Social Emotion Detection with Emotional Dependency,"Sentiment analysis of such opinionated online texts as reviews and comments has received increasingly close attention, yet most of the work is intended to deal with the detection of authors’ emotion. In contrast, this article presents our study of the social emotion detection problem, the objective of which is to identify the evoked emotions of readers by online documents such as news articles. A novel Latent Discriminative Model (LDM) is proposed for this task. LDM works by introducing intermediate hidden variables to model the latent structure of input text corpora. To achieve this, it defines a joint distribution over emotions and latent variables, conditioned on the observed text documents. Moreover, we assume that social emotions are not independent but correlated with one another, and the dependency of them is capable of providing additional guidance to LDM in the training process. The inclusion of this emotional dependency into LDM gives rise to a new Emotional Dependency-based LDM (eLDM). We evaluate the proposed models through a series of empirical evaluations on two real-world corpora of news articles. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of LDM and eLDM in social emotion detection.","[{""name"":""Xiaojun Quan"",""id"":""/profile/81418596606""},{""name"":""Qifan Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659573932""},{""name"":""Ying Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659520447""},{""name"":""Luo Si"",""id"":""/profile/81100394305""},{""name"":""Liu Wenyin"",""id"":""/profile/81100302430""},{""name"":""Xiaojun Quan"",""id"":""/profile/81418596606""},{""name"":""Qifan Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659573932""},{""name"":""Ying Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659520447""},{""name"":""Luo Si"",""id"":""/profile/81100394305""},{""name"":""Liu Wenyin"",""id"":""/profile/81100302430""}]","[""C.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2766447,Deep Dependency Substructure-Based Learning for Multidocument Summarization,"Most extractive style topic-focused multidocument summarization systems generate a summary by ranking textual units in multiple documents and extracting a proper subset of sentences biased to the given topic. Usually, the textual units are simply represented as sentences or n-grams, which do not carry deep syntactic and semantic information. This article presents a novel extractive topic-focused multidocument summarization framework. The framework proposes a new kind of more meaningful and informative units named frequent Deep Dependency Sub-Structure (DDSS) and a topic-sensitive Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model for frequent DDSS ranking. Given a document set, first, we parse all the sentences into deep dependency structures with a Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) parser and mine the frequent DDSSs after semantic normalization. Then we employ a topic-sensitive MTL model to learn the importance of these frequent DDSSs. Finally, we exploit an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation and use the frequent DDSSs as the essentials for summary extraction. Experimental results on two DUC datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Both the DDSS information and the topic-sensitive MTL model are validated to be very helpful for topic-focused multidocument summarization.","[{""name"":""Su Yan"",""id"":""/profile/99658675421""},{""name"":""Xiaojun Wan"",""id"":""/profile/81339534515""},{""name"":""Su Yan"",""id"":""/profile/99658675421""},{""name"":""Xiaojun Wan"",""id"":""/profile/81339534515""}]","[""C.

Most recent efforts have proposed several efficient methods to learn word embeddings from context such that they can encode both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. However, it is quite challenging to handle unseen or rare words with insufficient context. Inspired by the study on the word recognition process in cognitive psychology, in this article, we propose to take advantage of seemingly less obvious but essentially important morphological knowledge to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that leverages both words’ contextual information and morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings. Meanwhile, this new learning architecture is also able to benefit from noisy knowledge and balance between contextual information and morphological knowledge. Experiments on an analogical reasoning task and a word similarity task both demonstrate that the proposed KNET framework can greatly enhance the effectiveness of word embeddings.","[{""name"":""Qing Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81458655006""},{""name"":""Bin Gao"",""id"":""/profile/81309492847""},{""name"":""Jiang Bian"",""id"":""/profile/81350602276""},{""name"":""Siyu Qiu"",""id"":""/profile/99658738566""},{""name"":""Hanjun Dai"",""id"":""/profile/99659527663""},{""name"":""Tie-Yan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81350580267""},{""name"":""Qing Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81458655006""},{""name"":""Bin Gao"",""id"":""/profile/81309492847""},{""name"":""Jiang Bian"",""id"":""/profile/81350602276""},{""name"":""Siyu Qiu"",""id"":""/profile/99658738566""},{""name"":""Hanjun Dai"",""id"":""/profile/99659527663""},{""name"":""Tie-Yan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81350580267""}]","[""Y.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2809786,MWI-Sum: A Multilingual Summarizer Based on Frequent Weighted Itemsets,"Multidocument summarization addresses the selection of a compact subset of highly informative sentences, i.e., the summary, from a collection of textual documents. To perform sentence selection, two parallel strategies have been proposed: (a) apply general-purpose techniques relying on data mining or information retrieval techniques, and/or (b) perform advanced linguistic analysis relying on semantics-based models (e.g., ontologies) to capture the actual sentence meaning. Since there is an increasing need for processing documents written in different languages, the attention of the research community has recently focused on summarizers based on strategy (a).This article presents a novel multilingual summarizer, namely MWI-Sum (Multilingual Weighted Itemset-based Summarizer), that exploits an itemset-based model to summarize collections of documents ranging over the same topic. Unlike previous approaches, it extracts frequent weighted itemsets tailored to the analyzed collection and uses them to drive the sentence selection process. Weighted itemsets represent correlations among multiple highly relevant terms that are neglected by previous approaches. The proposed approach makes minimal use of language-dependent analyses. Thus, it is easily applicable to document collections written in different languages.Experiments performed on benchmark and real-life collections, English-written and not, demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than state-of-the-art multilingual document summarizers.","[{""name"":""Elena Baralis"",""id"":""/profile/81100468804""},{""name"":""Luca Cagliero"",""id"":""/profile/81453655181""},{""name"":""Alessandro Fiori"",""id"":""/profile/81375594978""},{""name"":""Paolo Garza"",""id"":""/profile/81100349712""},{""name"":""Elena Baralis"",""id"":""/profile/81100468804""},{""name"":""Luca Cagliero"",""id"":""/profile/81453655181""},{""name"":""Alessandro Fiori"",""id"":""/profile/81375594978""},{""name"":""Paolo Garza"",""id"":""/profile/81100349712""}]","[""John Atkinson and Ricardo Munoz. 2013.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2809787,A Document Retrieval Model Based on Digital Signal Filtering,"Information retrieval (IR) systems are designed, in general, to satisfy the information need of a user who expresses it by means of a query, by providing him with a subset of documents selected from a collection and ordered by decreasing relevance to the query. Such systems are based on IR models, which define how to represent the documents and the query, as well as how to determine the relevance of a document for a query. In this article, we present a new IR model based on concepts taken from both IR and digital signal processing (like Fourier analysis of signals and filtering). This allows the whole IR process to be seen as a physical phenomenon, where the query corresponds to a signal, the documents correspond to filters, and the determination of the relevant documents to the query is done by filtering that signal. Tests showed that the quality of the results provided by this IR model is comparable with the state-of-the-art.","[{""name"":""Alberto Costa"",""id"":""/profile/81485652020""},{""name"":""Emanuele Di Buccio"",""id"":""/profile/83358682957""},{""name"":""Massimo Melucci"",""id"":""/profile/81100207501""},{""name"":""Alberto Costa"",""id"":""/profile/81485652020""},{""name"":""Emanuele Di Buccio"",""id"":""/profile/83358682957""},{""name"":""Massimo Melucci"",""id"":""/profile/81100207501""}]","[""G.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2746230,Transfer Learning to Infer Social Ties across Heterogeneous Networks,"Interpersonal ties are responsible for the structure of social networks and the transmission of information through these networks. Different types of social ties have essentially different influences on people. Awareness of the types of social ties can benefit many applications, such as recommendation and community detection. For example, our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, while our classmates may be distributed into different communities. Though a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of predicting social ties across multiple heterogeneous networks.In this work, we develop a framework referred to as TranFG for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of predicting the types of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. We also present several active learning strategies to further enhance the inferring performance. To scale up the model to handle really large networks, we design a distributed learning algorithm for the proposed model.We evaluate the proposed framework (TranFG) on six different networks and compare with several existing methods. TranFG clearly outperforms the existing methods on multiple metrics. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, TranFG is able to obtain an F1-score of 90% (8%--28% improvements over alternative methods) for predicting manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network. The proposed model is efficient. It takes only a few minutes to train the proposed transfer model on large networks containing tens of thousands of nodes.","[{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""},{""name"":""Tiancheng Lou"",""id"":""/profile/81413604280""},{""name"":""Jon Kleinberg"",""id"":""/profile/81100288264""},{""name"":""Sen Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81488646487""},{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""},{""name"":""Tiancheng Lou"",""id"":""/profile/81413604280""},{""name"":""Jon Kleinberg"",""id"":""/profile/81100288264""},{""name"":""Sen Wu"",""id"":""/profile/81488646487""}]","[""Lada A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2816815,Power Law Distributions in Information Retrieval,"Several properties of information retrieval (IR) data, such as query frequency or document length, are widely considered to be approximately distributed as a power law. This common assumption aims to focus on specific characteristics of the empirical probability distribution of such data (e.g., its scale-free nature or its long/fat tail). This assumption, however, may not be always true. Motivated by recent work in the statistical treatment of power law claims, we investigate two research questions: (i) To what extent do power law approximations hold for term frequency, document length, query frequency, query length, citation frequency, and syntactic unigram frequency? And (ii) what is the computational cost of replacing ad hoc power law approximations with more accurate distribution fitting? We study 23 TREC and 5 non-TREC datasets and compare the fit of power laws to 15 other standard probability distributions. We find that query frequency and 5 out of 24 term frequency distributions are best approximated by a power law. All remaining properties are better approximated by the Inverse Gaussian, Generalized Extreme Value, Negative Binomial, or Yule distribution. We also find the overhead of replacing power law approximations by more informed distribution fitting to be negligible, with potential gains to IR tasks like index compression or test collection generation for IR evaluation.","[{""name"":""Casper Petersen"",""id"":""/profile/99658753242""},{""name"":""Jakob Grue Simonsen"",""id"":""/profile/81100412477""},{""name"":""Christina Lioma"",""id"":""/profile/81332512582""},{""name"":""Casper Petersen"",""id"":""/profile/99658753242""},{""name"":""Jakob Grue Simonsen"",""id"":""/profile/81100412477""},{""name"":""Christina Lioma"",""id"":""/profile/81332512582""}]","[""Lada A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2824253,Influence Estimation and Maximization in Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks,"If a piece of information is released from a set of media sites, can it spread, in 1 month, to a million web pages? Can we efficiently find a small set of media sites among millions that can maximize the spread of the information, in 1 month? The two problems are called influence estimation and maximization problems respectively, which are very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the problems and the issue of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this article, we propose two algorithms for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. The first one uses continuous-time Markov chains to estimate influence exactly on networks with exponential, or, more generally, phase-type transmission functions, but does not scale to large-scale networks, and the second one is a highly efficient randomized algorithm, which estimates the influence of every node in a network with general transmission functions, |ν| nodes and |ε| edges to an accuracy of ϵ using n = O(1/ϵ2) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|ε|+n|ν| computations. We then show that finding the set of most influential source nodes in a continuous time diffusion network is an NP-hard problem and develop an efficient greedy algorithm with provable near-optimal performance. When used as subroutines in the influence maximization algorithm, the exact influence estimation algorithm is guaranteed to find a set of C nodes with an influence of at least (1 − 1/e)OPT and the randomized algorithm is guaranteed to find a set with an influence of at least 1 − 1/e)OPT − 2Cε, where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed algorithms significantly improve over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes to maximize the influence, and the randomized algorithm can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes.","[{""name"":""Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez"",""id"":""/profile/81466648390""},{""name"":""Le Song"",""id"":""/profile/81100578710""},{""name"":""Nan Du"",""id"":""/profile/99659218449""},{""name"":""Hongyuan Zha"",""id"":""/profile/81490670693""},{""name"":""Bernhard Schölkopf"",""id"":""/profile/81100216460""},{""name"":""Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez"",""id"":""/profile/81466648390""},{""name"":""Le Song"",""id"":""/profile/81100578710""},{""name"":""Nan Du"",""id"":""/profile/99659218449""},{""name"":""Hongyuan Zha"",""id"":""/profile/81490670693""},{""name"":""Bernhard Schölkopf"",""id"":""/profile/81100216460""}]","[""S.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2832907,Volunteerism Tendency Prediction via Harvesting Multiple Social Networks,"Volunteers have always been extremely crucial and in urgent need for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to sustain their continuing operations. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to recruit volunteers using traditional approaches. In the Web 2.0 era, abundant and ubiquitous social media data opens a door to the possibility of automatic volunteer identification. In this article, we aim to fully explore this possibility by proposing a scheme that is able to predict users’ volunteerism tendency from user-generated contents collected from multiple social networks based on a conceptual volunteering decision model. We conducted comprehensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and further discussed its generalizibility and extendability. This novel interdisciplinary research will potentially inspire more promising and important human-centered applications.","[{""name"":""Xuemeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99658613490""},{""name"":""Zhao-Yan Ming"",""id"":""/profile/81350573523""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Yi-Liang Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81481648186""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Xuemeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99658613490""},{""name"":""Zhao-Yan Ming"",""id"":""/profile/81350573523""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Yi-Liang Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81481648186""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""}]","[""Fabian Abel, Eelco Herder, Geert-Jan Houben, Nicola Henze, and Daniel Krause. 2013.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2838731,A Tensor-Based Information Framework for Predicting the Stock Market,"To study the influence of information on the behavior of stock markets, a common strategy in previous studies has been to concatenate the features of various information sources into one compound feature vector, a procedure that makes it more difficult to distinguish the effects of different information sources. We maintain that capturing the intrinsic relations among multiple information sources is important for predicting stock trends. The challenge lies in modeling the complex space of various sources and types of information and studying the effects of this information on stock market behavior. For this purpose, we introduce a tensor-based information framework to predict stock movements. Specifically, our framework models the complex investor information environment with tensors. A global dimensionality-reduction algorithm is used to capture the links among various information sources in a tensor, and a sequence of tensors is used to represent information gathered over time. Finally, a tensor-based predictive model to forecast stock movements, which is in essence a high-order tensor regression learning problem, is presented. Experiments performed on an entire year of data for China Securities Index stocks demonstrate that a trading system based on our framework outperforms the classic Top-N trading strategy and two state-of-the-art media-aware trading algorithms.","[{""name"":""Qing Li"",""id"":""/profile/81442612574""},{""name"":""Yuanzhu Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99658724409""},{""name"":""Li Ling Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/99658981144""},{""name"":""Ping Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658711897""},{""name"":""Hsinchun Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81452604957""},{""name"":""Qing Li"",""id"":""/profile/81442612574""},{""name"":""Yuanzhu Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99658724409""},{""name"":""Li Ling Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/99658981144""},{""name"":""Ping Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658711897""},{""name"":""Hsinchun Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81452604957""}]","[""Christopher Avery and Peter Zemsky. 1998.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2858657,Subspace Frequency Analysis--Based Field Indices Extraction for Electricity Customer Classification,"In electricity customer classification, the most important task is to avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, as the consumption diagrams have a large number of dimensions. To avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, field indices (load shape factor) are often used instead of consumption diagrams. Field indices are directly extracted from consumption diagrams according to a predefined formula. Previous studies show that the most important thing for defining such a formula is to find meaningful time intervals from consumption diagrams. However, the inconvenient thing is that there are still a lack of details to explain how to define such time intervals.In our study, we propose a data mining--based method named SFATIE to support the extraction of field indices. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with other dimensionality reduction methods during the classification. For the classification, most often we have used classification methods like C5.0, SVM, Neural Net, Bayes Net, and Logistic. The experimental results show that our method is better or close to other dimensionality reduction methods. In addition, the experimental results show that our proposed method can produce the good quality of field indices and that these indices can improve the performance of electricity customer classification.","[{""name"":""Minghao Piao"",""id"":""/profile/81375616428""},{""name"":""Keun Ho Ryu"",""id"":""/profile/81451592576""},{""name"":""Minghao Piao"",""id"":""/profile/81375616428""},{""name"":""Keun Ho Ryu"",""id"":""/profile/81451592576""}]","[""Charu C.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2846092,On Effective Location-Aware Music Recommendation,"Rapid advances in mobile devices and cloud-based music service now allow consumers to enjoy music anytime and anywhere. Consequently, there has been an increasing demand in studying intelligent techniques to facilitate context-aware music recommendation. However, one important context that is generally overlooked is user’s venue, which often includes surrounding atmosphere, correlates with activities, and greatly influences the user’s music preferences. In this article, we present a novel venue-aware music recommender system called VenueMusic to effectively identify suitable songs for various types of popular venues in our daily lives. Toward this goal, a Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) is proposed to (i) mine the common features of songs that are suitable for a venue type in a latent semantic space and (ii) represent songs and venue types in the shared latent space, in which songs and venue types can be directly matched. It is worth mentioning that to discover meaningful latent topics with the LTM, a Music Concept Sequence Generation (MCSG) scheme is designed to extract effective semantic representations for songs. An extensive experimental study based on two large music test collections demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and MCSG scheme. The comparisons with state-of-the-art music recommender systems demonstrate the superior performance of VenueMusic system on recommendation accuracy by associating venue and music contents using a latent semantic space. This work is a pioneering study on the development of a venue-aware music recommender system. The results show the importance of considering the influence of venue types in the development of context-aware music recommender systems.","[{""name"":""Zhiyong Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/87958925057""},{""name"":""Jialie Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81100344947""},{""name"":""Zhiyong Cheng"",""id"":""/profile/87958925057""},{""name"":""Jialie Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81100344947""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2893478,"Digital Wildfires: Propagation, Verification, Regulation, and Responsible Innovation","Social media platforms provide an increasingly popular means for individuals to share content online. Whilst this produces undoubted societal benefits, the ability for content to be spontaneously posted and reposted creates an ideal environment for rumour and false/malicious information to spread rapidly. When this occurs it can cause significant harm and can be characterised as a “digital wildfire.” In this article, we demonstrate that the propagation and regulation of digital wildfires form important topics for research and conduct an overview of existing work in this area. We outline the relevance of a range of work from the computational and social sciences, including a series of insights into the propagation of rumour and false/malicious information. We argue that significant research gaps remain—for instance, there is an absence of systematic studies on the effects of digital wildfires and there is a need to combine empirical research with a consideration of how the responsible governance of social media can be determined. We propose an agenda for research that establishes a methodology to explore in full the propagation and regulation of unverified content on social media. This agenda promotes high-quality interdisciplinary research that will also inform policy debates.","[{""name"":""Helena Webb"",""id"":""/profile/99658969286""},{""name"":""Pete Burnap"",""id"":""/profile/81414621356""},{""name"":""Rob Procter"",""id"":""/profile/81100608758""},{""name"":""Omer Rana"",""id"":""/profile/82658802457""},{""name"":""Bernd Carsten Stahl"",""id"":""/profile/81100377929""},{""name"":""Matthew Williams"",""id"":""/profile/99658690438""},{""name"":""William Housley"",""id"":""/profile/99658689467""},{""name"":""Adam Edwards"",""id"":""/profile/99658688179""},{""name"":""Marina Jirotka"",""id"":""/profile/81100398221""},{""name"":""Helena Webb"",""id"":""/profile/99658969286""},{""name"":""Pete Burnap"",""id"":""/profile/81414621356""},{""name"":""Rob Procter"",""id"":""/profile/81100608758""},{""name"":""Omer Rana"",""id"":""/profile/82658802457""},{""name"":""Bernd Carsten Stahl"",""id"":""/profile/81100377929""},{""name"":""Matthew Williams"",""id"":""/profile/99658690438""},{""name"":""William Housley"",""id"":""/profile/99658689467""},{""name"":""Adam Edwards"",""id"":""/profile/99658688179""},{""name"":""Marina Jirotka"",""id"":""/profile/81100398221""}]","[""A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2842604,Geoparsing and Geosemantics for Social Media: Spatiotemporal Grounding of Content Propagating Rumors to Support Trust and Veracity Analysis during Breaking News,"In recent years, there has been a growing trend to use publicly available social media sources within the field of journalism. Breaking news has tight reporting deadlines, measured in minutes not days, but content must still be checked and rumors verified. As such, journalists are looking at automated content analysis to prefilter large volumes of social media content prior to manual verification. This article describes a real-time social media analytics framework for journalists. We extend our previously published geoparsing approach to improve its scalability and efficiency. We develop and evaluate a novel approach to geosemantic feature extraction, classifying evidence in terms of situatedness, timeliness, confirmation, and validity. Our approach works for new unseen news topics. We report results from four experiments using five Twitter datasets crawled during different English-language news events. One of our datasets is the standard TREC 2012 microblog corpus. Our classification results are promising, with F1 scores varying by class from 0.64 to 0.92 for unseen event types. We lastly report results from two case studies during real-world news stories, showcasing different ways our system can assist journalists filter and cross-check content as they examine the trust and veracity of content and sources.","[{""name"":""Stuart E.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2858791,TISoN: Trust Inference in Trust-Oriented Social Networks,"Trust systems represent a significant trend in decision support for social networks’ service provision. The basic idea is to allow users to rate each other even without being direct neighbours. In this case, the purpose is to derive a trust score for a given user, which could be of help to decide whether to trust other users or not. In this article, we investigate the properties of trust propagation within social networks, based on the notion of transitivity, and we introduce the TISoN model to generate and evaluate Trust Inference within online Social Networks. To do so, (i) we develop a novel TPS algorithm for Trust Path Searching where we define neighbours’ priority based on their direct trust degrees, and then select trusted paths while controlling the path length; and, (ii) we develop different TIM algorithms for Trust Inference Measuring and build a trust network. In addition, we analyse existing algorithms and we demonstrate that our proposed model better computes transitive trust values than do the existing models. We conduct extensive experiments on a real online social network dataset, Advogato. Experimental results show that our work is scalable and generates better results than do the pioneering approaches of the literature.","[{""name"":""Sana Hamdi"",""id"":""/profile/81482649100""},{""name"":""Alda Lopes Gancarski"",""id"":""/profile/81100009503""},{""name"":""Amel Bouzeghoub"",""id"":""/profile/81100413297""},{""name"":""Sadok Ben Yahia"",""id"":""/profile/81100197903""},{""name"":""Sana Hamdi"",""id"":""/profile/81482649100""},{""name"":""Alda Lopes Gancarski"",""id"":""/profile/81100009503""},{""name"":""Amel Bouzeghoub"",""id"":""/profile/81100413297""},{""name"":""Sadok Ben Yahia"",""id"":""/profile/81100197903""}]","[""Samah Al-Oufi, Heung-Nam Kim, and Abdulmotaleb El-Saddik. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2885494,Misinformation in Online Social Networks: Detect Them All with a Limited Budget,"Online social networks have become an effective and important social platform for communication, opinions exchange, and information sharing. However, they also make it possible for rapid and wide misinformation diffusion, which may lead to pernicious influences on individuals or society. Hence, it is extremely important and necessary to detect the misinformation propagation by placing monitors.In this article, we first define a general misinformation-detection problem for the case where the knowledge about misinformation sources is lacking, and show its equivalence to the influence-maximization problem in the reverse graph. Furthermore, considering node vulnerability, we aim to detect the misinformation reaching to a specific user. Therefore, we study a τ-Monitor Placement problem for cases where partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available and prove its #P complexity. We formulate a corresponding integer program, tackle exponential constraints, and propose a Minimum Monitor Set Construction (MMSC) algorithm, in which the cut-set2 has been exploited in the estimation of reachability of node pairs. Moreover, we generalize the problem from a single target to multiple central nodes and propose another algorithm based on a Monte Carlo sampling technique. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms with respect to minimizing the number of monitors.","[{""name"":""Huiling Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659000481""},{""name"":""Md Abdul Alim"",""id"":""/profile/81435601016""},{""name"":""Xiang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658705894""},{""name"":""My T.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2926790,Query Performance Prediction Using Reference Lists,"The task of query performance prediction is to estimate the effectiveness of search performed in response to a query when no relevance judgments are available. We present a novel probabilistic analysis of the performance prediction task. The analysis gives rise to a general prediction framework that uses pseudo-effective or ineffective document lists that are retrieved in response to the query. These lists serve as reference to the result list at hand, the effectiveness of which we want to predict. We show that many previously proposed prediction methods can be explained using our framework. More generally, we shed new light on existing prediction methods and establish formal common grounds to seemingly different prediction approaches. In addition, we formally demonstrate the connection between prediction using reference lists and fusion of retrieved lists, and provide empirical support to this connection. Through an extensive empirical exploration, we study various factors that affect the quality of prediction using reference lists.","[{""name"":""Anna Shtok"",""id"":""/profile/81442617702""},{""name"":""Oren Kurland"",""id"":""/profile/81100462276""},{""name"":""David Carmel"",""id"":""/profile/81548005684""},{""name"":""Anna Shtok"",""id"":""/profile/81442617702""},{""name"":""Oren Kurland"",""id"":""/profile/81100462276""},{""name"":""David Carmel"",""id"":""/profile/81548005684""}]","[""James Allan, Margaret E.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2866571,Comparing Pointwise and Listwise Objective Functions for Random-Forest-Based Learning-to-Rank,"Current random-forest (RF)-based learning-to-rank (LtR) algorithms use a classification or regression framework to solve the ranking problem in a pointwise manner. The success of this simple yet effective approach coupled with the inherent parallelizability of the learning algorithm makes it a strong candidate for widespread adoption. In this article, we aim to better understand the effectiveness of RF-based rank-learning algorithms with a focus on the comparison between pointwise and listwise approaches.We introduce what we believe to be the first listwise version of an RF-based LtR algorithm. The algorithm directly optimizes an information retrieval metric of choice (in our case, NDCG) in a greedy manner. Direct optimization of the listwise objective functions is computationally prohibitive for most learning algorithms, but possible in RF since each tree maximizes the objective in a coordinate-wise fashion. Computational complexity of the listwise approach is higher than the pointwise counterpart; hence for larger datasets, we design a hybrid algorithm that combines a listwise objective in the early stages of tree construction and a pointwise objective in the latter stages. We also study the effect of the discount function of NDCG on the listwise algorithm.Experimental results on several publicly available LtR datasets reveal that the listwise/hybrid algorithm outperforms the pointwise approach on the majority (but not all) of the datasets. We then investigate several aspects of the two algorithms to better understand the inevitable performance tradeoffs. The aspects include examining an RF-based unsupervised LtR algorithm and comparing individual tree strength. Finally, we compare the the investigated RF-based algorithms with several other LtR algorithms.","[{""name"":""Muhammad Ibrahim"",""id"":""/profile/99659062725""},{""name"":""Mark Carman"",""id"":""/profile/81100008835""},{""name"":""Muhammad Ibrahim"",""id"":""/profile/99659062725""},{""name"":""Mark Carman"",""id"":""/profile/81100008835""}]","[""Gérard Biau. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2854147,Probabilistic Models for Contextual Agreement in Preferences,"The long-tail theory for consumer demand implies the need for more accurate personalization technologies to target items to the users who most desire them. A key tenet of personalization is the capacity to model user preferences. Most of the previous work on recommendation and personalization has focused primarily on individual preferences. While some focus on shared preferences between pairs of users, they assume that the same similarity value applies to all items. Here we investigate the notion of “context,” hypothesizing that while two users may agree on their preferences on some items, they may also disagree on other items. To model this, we design probabilistic models for the generation of rating differences between pairs of users across different items. Since this model also involves the estimation of rating differences on unseen items for the purpose of prediction, we further conduct a systematic analysis of matrix factorization and tensor factorization methods in this estimation, and propose a factorization model with a novel objective function of minimizing error in rating differences. Experiments on several real-life rating datasets show that our proposed model consistently yields context-specific similarity values that perform better on a prediction task than models relying on shared preferences.","[{""name"":""Loc Do"",""id"":""/profile/87658700657""},{""name"":""Hady W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2956234,TopPRF: A Probabilistic Framework for Integrating Topic Space into Pseudo Relevance Feedback,"Traditional pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) models choose top k feedback documents for query expansion and treat those documents equally. When k is determined, feedback terms are selected without considering the reliability of these documents for relevance. Because the performance of PRF is sensitive to the selection of feedback terms, noisy terms imported from these irrelevant documents or partially relevant documents will harm the final results extensively. Intuitively, terms in these documents should be considered less important for feedback term selection. Nonetheless, how to measure the reliability of feedback documents is a difficult problem.Recently, topic modeling has become more and more popular in the information retrieval (IR) area. In order to identify how reliable a feedback document is to be relevant, we attempt to adapt the topical information into PRF. However, topics are hard to be quantified and therefore the identification of topic is usually fuzzy. It is very challenging for integrating the obtained topical information effectively into IR and other text-processing-related areas. Current research work mainly focuses on mining relevant information from particular topics. This is extremely difficult when the boundaries of different topics are hard to define. In this article, we investigate a key factor of this problem, the topic number for topic modeling and how it makes topics “fuzzy.” To effectively and efficiently apply topical information, we propose a new probabilistic framework, “TopPRF,” and three models, TS-COS, TS-EU, and TS-Entropy, via integrating “Topic Space” (TS) information into pseudo relevance feedback. These methods discover how reliable a document is to be relevant through both term and topical information. When selecting feedback terms, candidate terms in more reliable feedback documents should obtain extra weights. Experimental results on various public collections justify that our proposed methods can significantly reduce the influence of “fuzzy topics” and obtain stable, good results over the strong baseline models. Our proposed probabilistic framework, TopPRF, and three topic-space-based models are capable of searching documents beyond traditional term matching only and provide a promising avenue for constructing better topic-space-based IR systems. Moreover, in-depth discussions and conclusions are made to help other researchers apply topical information effectively.","[{""name"":""Jun Miao"",""id"":""/profile/81508701956""},{""name"":""Jimmy Xiangji Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81100080207""},{""name"":""Jiashu Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81447597253""},{""name"":""Jun Miao"",""id"":""/profile/81508701956""},{""name"":""Jimmy Xiangji Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81100080207""},{""name"":""Jiashu Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81447597253""}]","[""J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2882782,Examining Additivity and Weak Baselines,"We present a study of which baseline to use when testing a new retrieval technique. In contrast to past work, we show that measuring a statistically significant improvement over a weak baseline is not a good predictor of whether a similar improvement will be measured on a strong baseline. Sometimes strong baselines are made worse when a new technique is applied. We investigate whether conducting comparisons against a range of weaker baselines can increase confidence that an observed effect will also show improvements on a stronger baseline. Our results indicate that this is not the case -- at best, testing against a range of baselines means that an experimenter can be more confident that the new technique is unlikely to significantly harm a strong baseline. Examining recent past work, we present evidence that the information retrieval (IR) community continues to test against weak baselines. This is unfortunate as, in light of our experiments, we conclude that the only way to be confident that a new technique is a contribution is to compare it against nothing less than the state of the art.","[{""name"":""Sadegh Kharazmi"",""id"":""/profile/81387609168""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""David Vallet"",""id"":""/profile/81503659397""},{""name"":""Mark Sanderson"",""id"":""/profile/81100454785""},{""name"":""Sadegh Kharazmi"",""id"":""/profile/81387609168""},{""name"":""Falk Scholer"",""id"":""/profile/81100427119""},{""name"":""David Vallet"",""id"":""/profile/81503659397""},{""name"":""Mark Sanderson"",""id"":""/profile/81100454785""}]","[""R.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2903719,Measuring the Semantic Uncertainty of News Events for Evolution Potential Estimation,"The evolution potential estimation of news events can support the decision making of both corporations and governments. For example, a corporation could manage its public relations crisis in a timely manner if a negative news event about this corporation is known with large evolution potential in advance. However, existing state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on time series historical data, which are not suitable for the news events with limited historical data and bursty properties. In this article, we propose a purely content-based method to estimate the evolution potential of the news events. The proposed method considers a news event at a given time point as a system composed of different keywords, and the uncertainty of this system is defined and measured as the Semantic Uncertainty of this news event. At the same time, an uncertainty space is constructed with two extreme states: the most uncertain state and the most certain state. We believe that the Semantic Uncertainty has correlation with the content evolution of the news events, so it can be used to estimate the evolution potential of the news events. In order to verify the proposed method, we present detailed experimental setups and results measuring the correlation of the Semantic Uncertainty with the Content Change of news events using collected news events data. The results show that the correlation does exist and is stronger than the correlation of value from the time-series-based method with the Content Change. Therefore, we can use the Semantic Uncertainty to estimate the evolution potential of news events.","[{""name"":""Xiangfeng Luo"",""id"":""/profile/81319496844""},{""name"":""Junyu Xuan"",""id"":""/profile/81490647887""},{""name"":""Jie Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81100053452""},{""name"":""Guangquan Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81335500303""},{""name"":""Xiangfeng Luo"",""id"":""/profile/81319496844""},{""name"":""Junyu Xuan"",""id"":""/profile/81490647887""},{""name"":""Jie Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81100053452""},{""name"":""Guangquan Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81335500303""}]","[""Lada A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2910579,Diversifying Query Auto-Completion,"Query auto-completion assists web search users in formulating queries with a few keystrokes, helping them to avoid spelling mistakes and to produce clear query expressions, and so on. Previous work on query auto-completion mainly centers around returning a list of completions to users, aiming to push queries that are most likely intended by the user to the top positions but ignoring the redundancy among the query candidates in the list. Thus, semantically related queries matching the input prefix are often returned together. This may push valuable suggestions out of the list, given that only a limited number of candidates can be shown to the user, which may result in a less than optimal search experience.In this article, we consider the task of diversifying query auto-completion, which aims to return the correct query completions early in a ranked list of candidate completions and at the same time reduce the redundancy among query auto-completion candidates. We develop a greedy query selection approach that predicts query completions based on the current search popularity of candidate completions and on the aspects of previous queries in the same search session. The popularity of completion candidates at query time can be directly aggregated from query logs. However, query aspects are implicitly expressed by previous clicked documents in the search context. To determine the query aspect, we categorize clicked documents of a query using a hierarchy based on the open directory project. Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization is applied to derive the distribution of queries over all aspects. We quantify the improvement of our greedy query selection model against a state-of-the-art baseline using two large-scale, real-world query logs and show that it beats the baseline in terms of well-known metrics used in query auto-completion and diversification. In addition, we conduct a side-by-side experiment to verify the effectiveness of our proposal.","[{""name"":""Fei Cai"",""id"":""/profile/81309501210""},{""name"":""Ridho Reinanda"",""id"":""/profile/99658734480""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Fei Cai"",""id"":""/profile/81309501210""},{""name"":""Ridho Reinanda"",""id"":""/profile/99658734480""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""}]","[""Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Alan Halverson, and Samuel Ieong. 2009.
