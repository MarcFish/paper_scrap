https://doi.org/10.1145/3041656,"Comparing the Archival Rate of Arabic, English, Danish, and Korean Language Web Pages","It has long been suspected that web archives and search engines favor Western and English language webpages. In this article, we quantitatively explore how well indexed and archived Arabic language webpages are as compared to those from other languages. We began by sampling 15,092 unique URIs from three different website directories: DMOZ (multilingual), Raddadi, and Star28 (the last two primarily Arabic language). Using language identification tools, we eliminated pages not in the Arabic language (e.g., English-language versions of Aljazeera pages) and culled the collection to 7,976 Arabic language webpages. We then used these 7,976 pages and crawled the live web and web archives to produce a collection of 300,646 Arabic language pages. We compared the analysis of Arabic language pages with that of English, Danish, and Korean language pages. First, for each language, we sampled unique URIs from DMOZ; then, using language identification tools, we kept only pages in the desired language. Finally, we crawled the archived and live web to collect a larger sample of pages in English, Danish, or Korean. In total for the four languages, we analyzed over 500,000 webpages. We discovered: (1) English has a higher archiving rate than Arabic, with 72.04% archived. However, Arabic has a higher archiving rate than Danish and Korean, with 53.36% of Arabic URIs archived, followed by Danish and Korean with 35.89% and 32.81% archived, respectively. (2) Most Arabic and English language pages are located in the United States; only 14.84% of the Arabic URIs had an Arabic country code top-level domain (e.g., sa) and only 10.53% had a GeoIP in an Arabic country. Most Danish-language pages were located in Denmark, and most Korean-language pages were located in South Korea. (3) The presence of a webpage in a directory positively impacts indexing and presence in the DMOZ directory, specifically, positively impacts archiving in all four languages. In this work, we show that web archives and search engines favor English pages. However, it is not universally true for all Western-language webpages because, in this work, we show that Arabic webpages have a higher archival rate than Danish language webpages.","[{""name"":""Lulwah M.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3052773,Clustered Elias-Fano Indexes,"State-of-the-art encoders for inverted indexes compress each posting list individually. Encoding clusters of posting lists offers the possibility of reducing the redundancy of the lists while maintaining a noticeable query processing speed.In this article, we propose a new index representation based on clustering the collection of posting lists and, for each created cluster, building an ad hoc reference list with respect to which all lists in the cluster are encoded with Elias-Fano. We describe a posting lists clustering algorithm tailored for our encoder and two methods for building the reference list for a cluster. Both approaches are heuristic and differ in the way postings are added to the reference list: according to their frequency in the cluster or according to the number of bits necessary for their representation.The extensive experimental analysis indicates that significant space reductions are indeed possible, beating the best state-of-the-art encoders.","[{""name"":""Giulio Ermanno Pibiri"",""id"":""/profile/99659151720""},{""name"":""Rossano Venturini"",""id"":""/profile/81327492057""},{""name"":""Giulio Ermanno Pibiri"",""id"":""/profile/99659151720""},{""name"":""Rossano Venturini"",""id"":""/profile/81327492057""}]","[""Charu Aggarwal and Chandan Reddy. 2013.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3041657,GVoS: A General System for Near-Duplicate Video-Related Applications on Storm,"The exponential increase of online videos greatly enriches the life of users but also brings huge numbers of near-duplicate videos (NDVs) that seriously challenge the video websites. The video websites entail NDV-related applications such as detection of copyright violation, video monitoring, video re-ranking, and video recommendation. Since these applications adopt different features and different processing procedures due to diverse scenarios, constructing separate and special-purpose systems for them incurs considerable costs on design, implementation, and maintenance. In this article, we propose a general NDV system on Storm (GVoS)—a popular distributed real-time stream processing platform—to simultaneously support a wide variety of video applications. The generality of GVoS is achieved in two aspects. First, we extract the reusable components from various applications. Second, we conduct the communication between components via a mechanism called Stream Shared Message (SSM) that contains the video-related data. Furthermore, we present an algorithm to reduce the size of SSM in order to avoid the data explosion and decrease the network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that GVoS can achieve performance almost the same as the customized systems. Meanwhile, GVoS accomplishes remarkably higher systematic versatility and efficiently facilitates the development of various NDV-related applications.","[{""name"":""Jiawei Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/99659164864""},{""name"":""Yunhai Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81314495036""},{""name"":""Hua Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81435605444""},{""name"":""Bin Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81100229109""},{""name"":""Kai Lei"",""id"":""/profile/83458673657""},{""name"":""Lele Yu"",""id"":""/profile/99658718478""},{""name"":""Jiawei Jiang"",""id"":""/profile/99659164864""},{""name"":""Yunhai Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81314495036""},{""name"":""Hua Lu"",""id"":""/profile/81435605444""},{""name"":""Bin Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81100229109""},{""name"":""Kai Lei"",""id"":""/profile/83458673657""},{""name"":""Lele Yu"",""id"":""/profile/99658718478""}]","[""James Allan, Courtney Wade, and Alvaro Bolivar. 2003.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3052774,Unifying Virtual and Physical Worlds: Learning Toward Local and Global Consistency,"Event-based social networking services, such as Meetup, are capable of linking online virtual interactions to offline physical activities. Compared to mono online social networking services (e.g., Twitter and Google+), such dual networks provide a complete picture of users’ online and offline behaviors that more often than not are compatible and complementary. In the light of this, we argue that joint learning over dual networks offers us a better way to comprehensively understand user behaviors and their underlying organizational principles. Despite its value, few efforts have been dedicated to jointly considering the following factors within a unified model: (1) local user contextualization, (2) global structure coherence, and (3) effectiveness evaluation. Toward this end, we propose a novel dual clustering model for community detection over dual networks to jointly model local consistency for a specific user and global consistency of partitioning results across networks. We theoretically derived its solution. In addition, we verified our model regarding multiple metrics from different aspects and applied it to the application of event attendance prediction.","[{""name"":""Xiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659076634""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Xuemeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99658613490""},{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""},{""name"":""Xiang Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659076634""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Xuemeng Song"",""id"":""/profile/99658613490""},{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Tat-Seng Chua"",""id"":""/profile/81100547902""}]","[""Matthew B.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3052775,IDF for Word N-grams,"Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is widely accepted term weighting scheme whose robustness is supported by many theoretical justifications. However, applying IDF to word N-grams (or simply N-grams) of any length without relying on heuristics has remained a challenging issue. This article describes a theoretical extension of IDF to handle N-grams. First, we elucidate the theoretical relationship between IDF and information distance, a universal metric defined by the Kolmogorov complexity. Based on our understanding of this relationship, we propose N-gram IDF, a new IDF family that gives fair weights to words and phrases of any length. Based only on the magnitude relation of N-gram IDF weights, dominant N-grams among overlapping N-grams can be determined. We also propose an efficient method to compute the N-gram IDF weights of all N-grams by leveraging the enhanced suffix array and wavelet tree. Because the exact computation of N-gram IDF provably requires significant computational cost, we modify it to a fast approximation method that can estimate weight errors analytically and maintain application-level performance. Empirical evaluations with unsupervised/supervised key term extraction and web search query segmentation with various experimental settings demonstrate the robustness and language-independent nature of the proposed N-gram IDF.","[{""name"":""Masumi Shirakawa"",""id"":""/profile/81414620995""},{""name"":""Takahiro Hara"",""id"":""/profile/81100089961""},{""name"":""Shojiro Nishio"",""id"":""/profile/81100649235""},{""name"":""Masumi Shirakawa"",""id"":""/profile/81414620995""},{""name"":""Takahiro Hara"",""id"":""/profile/81100089961""},{""name"":""Shojiro Nishio"",""id"":""/profile/81100649235""}]","[""Mohamed Ibrahim Abouelhoda, Stefan Kurtz, and Enno Ohlebusch. 2004.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3072652,SWIM: Stepped Weighted Shell Decomposition Influence Maximization for Large-Scale Networks,"A considerable amount of research has been devoted to the proposition of scalable algorithms for influence maximization. A number of such scalable algorithms exploit the community structure of the network. Besides the community structure, real-world social networks possess a different property, known as the layer structure. In this article, we propose a method based on the layer structure to maximize the influence in huge networks. Conducting experiments on a number of real-world networks, we will show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by its time complexity while having similar or slightly better final influence spread. Furthermore, unlike its predecessors, our method is able to show a high entanglement between structure and dynamics by giving insight on the reason why different networks have two contrasting behaviors in their saturation. By “saturation,” we mean a state during the seed selection process after which adjoining new nodes to the initial set will have a negligible effect on increasing the influence spread. We will demonstrate that how our method can predict the saturation dynamics in the networks. This prediction can be used to identify the network structures that are more vulnerable to the fast spread of the rumors.","[{""name"":""Ali Vardasbi"",""id"":""/profile/82858831557""},{""name"":""Heshaam Faili"",""id"":""/profile/81474704119""},{""name"":""Masoud Asadpour"",""id"":""/profile/81436593147""},{""name"":""Ali Vardasbi"",""id"":""/profile/82858831557""},{""name"":""Heshaam Faili"",""id"":""/profile/81474704119""},{""name"":""Masoud Asadpour"",""id"":""/profile/81436593147""}]","[""E.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3072614,Yum-Me: A Personalized Nutrient-Based Meal Recommender System,"Nutrient-based meal recommendations have the potential to help individuals prevent or manage conditions such as diabetes and obesity. However, learning people’s food preferences and making recommendations that simultaneously appeal to their palate and satisfy nutritional expectations are challenging. Existing approaches either only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged learning period. We propose Yum-me, a personalized nutrient-based meal recommender system designed to meet individuals’ nutritional expectations, dietary restrictions, and fine-grained food preferences. Yum-me enables a simple and accurate food preference profiling procedure via a visual quiz-based user interface and projects the learned profile into the domain of nutritionally appropriate food options to find ones that will appeal to the user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me and further describe and evaluate two innovative contributions. The first contriution is an open source state-of-the-art food image analysis model, named FoodDist. We demonstrate FoodDist’s superior performance through careful benchmarking and discuss its applicability across a wide array of dietary applications. The second contribution is a novel online learning framework that learns food preference from itemwise and pairwise image comparisons. We evaluate the framework in a field study of 227 anonymous users and demonstrate that it outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. We further conducted an end-to-end validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of Yum-me through a 60-person user study, in which Yum-me improves the recommendation acceptance rate by 42.63%.","[{""name"":""Longqi Yang"",""id"":""/profile/99658743067""},{""name"":""Cheng-Kang Hsieh"",""id"":""/profile/81553955456""},{""name"":""Hongjian Yang"",""id"":""/profile/99659187930""},{""name"":""John P.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3057282,Search Result Diversification in Short Text Streams,"We consider the problem of search result diversification for streams of short texts. Diversifying search results in short text streams is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the latent topics of short documents. To capture the changes of topics and the probabilities of documents for a given query at a specific time in a short text stream, we propose a dynamic Dirichlet multinomial mixture topic model, called D2M3, as well as a Gibbs sampling algorithm for the inference. We also propose a streaming diversification algorithm, SDA, that integrates the information captured by D2M3 with our proposed modified version of the PM-2 (Proportionality-based diversification Method -- second version) diversification algorithm. We conduct experiments on a Twitter dataset and find that SDA statistically significantly outperforms state-of-the-art non-streaming retrieval methods, plain streaming retrieval methods, as well as streaming diversification methods that use other dynamic topic models.","[{""name"":""Shangsong Liang"",""id"":""/profile/81556005056""},{""name"":""Emine Yilmaz"",""id"":""/profile/81508699683""},{""name"":""Hong Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81456606893""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3072591,Learning to Align Comments to News Topics,"With the rapid proliferation of social media, increasingly more people express their opinions and reviews (user-generated content (UGC)) on recent news articles through various online services, such as news portals, forums, discussion groups, and microblogs. Clearly, identifying hot topics that users greatly care about can improve readers’ news browsing experience and facilitate research into interaction analysis between news and UGC. Furthermore, it is of great benefit to public opinion monitoring and management for both industry and government agencies. However, it is extremely time consuming, if not impossible, to manually examine the large amount of available social content. In this article, we formally define the news comment alignment problem and propose a novel framework that: (1) automatically extracts topics from a given news article and its associated comments, (2) identifies and extends positive examples with different degrees of confidence using three methods (i.e., hypersphere, density, and cluster chain), and (3) completes the alignment between news sentences and comments through a weighted-SVM classifier. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","[{""name"":""Lei Hou"",""id"":""/profile/81502758946""},{""name"":""Juanzi Li"",""id"":""/profile/81350597955""},{""name"":""Xiao-Li Li"",""id"":""/profile/81423594355""},{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""},{""name"":""Xiaofei Guo"",""id"":""/profile/84460111757""},{""name"":""Lei Hou"",""id"":""/profile/81502758946""},{""name"":""Juanzi Li"",""id"":""/profile/81350597955""},{""name"":""Xiao-Li Li"",""id"":""/profile/81423594355""},{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""},{""name"":""Xiaofei Guo"",""id"":""/profile/84460111757""}]","[""Ahmet Aker, Emina Kurtic, A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3072606,Inferring Dynamic User Interests in Streams of Short Texts for User Clustering,"User clustering has been studied from different angles. In order to identify shared interests, behavior-based methods consider similar browsing or search patterns of users, whereas content-based methods use information from the contents of the documents visited by the users. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines.","[{""name"":""Shangsong Liang"",""id"":""/profile/81556005056""},{""name"":""Zhaochun Ren"",""id"":""/profile/82458722457""},{""name"":""Yukun Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659047097""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Emine Yilmaz"",""id"":""/profile/81508699683""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Shangsong Liang"",""id"":""/profile/81556005056""},{""name"":""Zhaochun Ren"",""id"":""/profile/82458722457""},{""name"":""Yukun Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659047097""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Emine Yilmaz"",""id"":""/profile/81508699683""},{""name"":""Maarten De Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""}]","[""Amr Ahmed and Eric P.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3091108,Enhancing Topic Modeling for Short Texts with Auxiliary Word Embeddings,"Many applications require semantic understanding of short texts, and inferring discriminative and coherent latent topics is a critical and fundamental task in these applications. Conventional topic models largely rely on word co-occurrences to derive topics from a collection of documents. However, due to the length of each document, short texts are much more sparse in terms of word co-occurrences. Recent studies show that the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model is effective for topic inference over short texts by assuming that each piece of short text is generated by a single topic. However, DMM has two main limitations. First, even though it seems reasonable to assume that each short text has only one topic because of its shortness, the definition of “shortness” is subjective and the length of the short texts is dataset dependent. That is, the single-topic assumption may be too strong for some datasets. To address this limitation, we propose to model the topic number as a Poisson distribution, allowing each short text to be associated with a small number of topics (e.g., one to three topics). This model is named PDMM. Second, DMM (and also PDMM) does not have access to background knowledge (e.g., semantic relations between words) when modeling short texts. When a human being interprets a piece of short text, the understanding is not solely based on its content words, but also their semantic relations. Recent advances in word embeddings offer effective learning of word semantic relations from a large corpus. Such auxiliary word embeddings enable us to address the second limitation. To this end, we propose to promote the semantically related words under the same topic during the sampling process, by using the generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model. Through the GPU model, background knowledge about word semantic relations learned from millions of external documents can be easily exploited to improve topic modeling for short texts. By directly extending the PDMM model with the GPU model, we propose two more effective topic models for short texts, named GPU-DMM and GPU-PDMM. Through extensive experiments on two real-world short text collections in two languages, we demonstrate that PDMM achieves better topic representations than state-of-the-art models, measured by topic coherence. The learned topic representation leads to better accuracy in a text classification task, as an indirect evaluation. Both GPU-DMM and GPU-PDMM further improve topic coherence and text classification accuracy. GPU-PDMM outperforms GPU-DMM at the price of higher computational costs.","[{""name"":""Chenliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658620810""},{""name"":""Yu Duan"",""id"":""/profile/99659195356""},{""name"":""Haoran Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659048948""},{""name"":""Zhiqian Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659048846""},{""name"":""Aixin Sun"",""id"":""/profile/81100446994""},{""name"":""Zongyang Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81508684706""},{""name"":""Chenliang Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658620810""},{""name"":""Yu Duan"",""id"":""/profile/99659195356""},{""name"":""Haoran Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659048948""},{""name"":""Zhiqian Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659048846""},{""name"":""Aixin Sun"",""id"":""/profile/81100446994""},{""name"":""Zongyang Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81508684706""}]","[""Yoshua Bengio, Holger Schwenk, Jean-Sébastien Senécal, Fréderic Morin, and Jean-Luc Gauvain. 2006.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086701,Using Replicates in Information Retrieval Evaluation,"This article explores a method for more accurately estimating the main effect of the system in a typical test-collection-based evaluation of information retrieval systems, thus increasing the sensitivity of system comparisons. Randomly partitioning the test document collection allows for multiple tests of a given system and topic (replicates). Bootstrap ANOVA can use these replicates to extract system-topic interactions—something not possible without replicates—yielding a more precise value for the system effect and a narrower confidence interval around that value. Experiments using multiple TREC collections demonstrate that removing the topic-system interactions substantially reduces the confidence intervals around the system effect as well as increases the number of significant pairwise differences found. Further, the method is robust against small changes in the number of partitions used, against variability in the documents that constitute the partitions, and the measure of effectiveness used to quantify system effectiveness.","[{""name"":""Ellen M.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086695,Fast and Flexible Top-k Similarity Search on Large Networks,"Similarity search is a fundamental problem in network analysis and can be applied in many applications, such as collaborator recommendation in coauthor networks, friend recommendation in social networks, and relation prediction in medical information networks. In this article, we propose a sampling-based method using random paths to estimate the similarities based on both common neighbors and structural contexts efficiently in very large homogeneous or heterogeneous information networks. We give a theoretical guarantee that the sampling size depends on the error-bound ε, the confidence level (1-δ), and the path length T of each random walk. We perform an extensive empirical study on a Tencent microblogging network of 1,000,000,000 edges. We show that our algorithm can return top-k similar vertices for any vertex in a network 300× faster than the state-of-the-art methods. We develop a prototype system of recommending similar authors to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","[{""name"":""Jing Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81408596200""},{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""},{""name"":""Cong Ma"",""id"":""/profile/99658731501""},{""name"":""Hanghang Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81337494052""},{""name"":""Yu Jing"",""id"":""/profile/99658740032""},{""name"":""Juanzi Li"",""id"":""/profile/81350597955""},{""name"":""Walter Luyten"",""id"":""/profile/99658986033""},{""name"":""Marie-Francine Moens"",""id"":""/profile/81100338843""},{""name"":""Jing Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81408596200""},{""name"":""Jie Tang"",""id"":""/profile/81548005696""},{""name"":""Cong Ma"",""id"":""/profile/99658731501""},{""name"":""Hanghang Tong"",""id"":""/profile/81337494052""},{""name"":""Yu Jing"",""id"":""/profile/99658740032""},{""name"":""Juanzi Li"",""id"":""/profile/81350597955""},{""name"":""Walter Luyten"",""id"":""/profile/99658986033""},{""name"":""Marie-Francine Moens"",""id"":""/profile/81100338843""}]","[""Charu C.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086700,Social Influence Spectrum at Scale: Near-Optimal Solutions for Multiple Budgets at Once,"Given a social network, the Influence Maximization (InfMax) problem seeks a seed set of k people that maximizes the expected influence for a viral marketing campaign. However, a solution for a particular seed size k is often not enough to make an informed choice regarding budget and cost-effectiveness.In this article, we propose the computation of Influence Spectrum (InfSpec), the maximum influence at each possible seed set size k within a given range [klower,kupper], thus providing optimal decision making for any availability of budget or influence requirements. As none of the existing methods for InfMax are efficient enough for the task in large networks, we propose LISA (sub-Linear Influence Spectrum Approximation), an efficient approximation algorithm for InfSpec (and also InfMax) with the best-known worst-case guarantees for billion-scale networks. LISA returns an (1-1/e -ϵ)-approximate influence spectrum with high probability (1-δ), where ϵ, δ are precision parameters provided by users. Using statistical decision theory, LISA has an asymptotic optimal running time (in addition to optimal approximation guarantee). In practice, LISA surpasses the state-of-the-art InfMax methods, taking less than 15 minutes to process a network of 41.7 million nodes and 1.5 billions edges.","[{""name"":""Hung T.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086820,Active Learning for Classification with Maximum Model Change,"Most existing active learning studies focus on designing sample selection algorithms. However, several fundamental problems deserve investigation to provide deep insight into active learning. In this article, we conduct an in-depth investigation on active learning for classification from the perspective of model change. We derive a general active learning framework for classification called maximum model change (MMC), which aims at querying the influential examples. The model change is quantified as the difference between the model parameters before and after training with the expanded training set. Inspired by the stochastic gradient update rule, the gradient of the loss with respect to a given candidate example is adopted to approximate the model change. This framework is applied to two popular classifiers: support vector machines and logistic regression. We analyze the convergence property of MMC and theoretically justify it. We explore the connection between MMC and uncertainty-based sampling to provide a uniform view. In addition, we discuss its potential usability to other learning models and show its applicability in a wide range of applications. We validate the MMC strategy on two kinds of benchmark datasets, the UCI repository and ImageNet, and show that it outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.","[{""name"":""Wenbin Cai"",""id"":""/profile/81549246756""},{""name"":""Yexun Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659199178""},{""name"":""Ya Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81418595344""},{""name"":""Siyuan Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/99658681334""},{""name"":""Wenquan Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99658675267""},{""name"":""Zhuoxiang Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659199252""},{""name"":""Chris Ding"",""id"":""/profile/81100136610""},{""name"":""Wenbin Cai"",""id"":""/profile/81549246756""},{""name"":""Yexun Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659199178""},{""name"":""Ya Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81418595344""},{""name"":""Siyuan Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/99658681334""},{""name"":""Wenquan Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99658675267""},{""name"":""Zhuoxiang Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659199252""},{""name"":""Chris Ding"",""id"":""/profile/81100136610""}]","[""N.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086703,DBpedia-Based Entity Linking via Greedy Search and Adjusted Monte Carlo Random Walk,"Facing a large amount of entities appearing on the web, entity linking has recently become useful. It assigns an entity from a resource to one name mention to help users grasp the meaning of this name mention. Unfortunately, many possible entities can be assigned to one name mention. Apparently, the usually co-occurring name mentions are related and can be considered together to determine their best assignments. This approach is called collective entity linking and is often conducted based on entity graph. However, traditional collective entity linking methods either consume much time due to the large scale of entity graph or obtain low accuracy due to simplifying graph. To improve both accuracy and efficiency, this article proposes a novel collective entity linking algorithm. It first constructs an entity graph by connecting any two related entities, and then a probability-based objective function is proposed on this graph to ensure the high accuracy of the linking result. Via this function, we convert entity linking to the process of finding the nodes with the highest PageRank Values. Greedy search and an adjusted Monte Carlo random walk are proposed to fulfill this work. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs much better than traditional linking methods.","[{""name"":""Ming Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81484642561""},{""name"":""Lei Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99658716279""},{""name"":""Bingquan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81414615435""},{""name"":""Guidong Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659199780""},{""name"":""Xiaoming Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659199158""},{""name"":""Ming Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81484642561""},{""name"":""Lei Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99658716279""},{""name"":""Bingquan Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81414615435""},{""name"":""Guidong Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659199780""},{""name"":""Xiaoming Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659199158""}]","[""K.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3086702,Parallelization of Massive Textstream Compression Based on Compressed Sensing,"Compressing textstreams generated by social networks can both reduce storage consumption and improve efficiency such as fast searching. However, the compression process is a challenge due to the large scale of textstreams. In this article, we propose a textstream compression framework based on compressed sensing theory and design a series of matching parallel procedures. The new approach uses a linear projection technique in the textstream compression process, achieving fast compression speed and low compression ratio. Two processes are executed by designing elaborated parallel procedures for efficient compressing and decompressing of large-scale textstreams. The decompression process is implemented for approximate solutions of underdetermined linear systems. Experimental results show that the new method can efficiently achieve the compression and decompression tasks on a large amount of text generated by social networks.","[{""name"":""Min Peng"",""id"":""/profile/99658742973""},{""name"":""Wang Gao"",""id"":""/profile/99659130407""},{""name"":""Hua Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81485659695""},{""name"":""Yanchun Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81487649465""},{""name"":""Jiajia Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99658752464""},{""name"":""Qianqian Xie"",""id"":""/profile/99659195721""},{""name"":""Gang Hu"",""id"":""/profile/99659195693""},{""name"":""Gang Tian"",""id"":""/profile/99659195436""},{""name"":""Min Peng"",""id"":""/profile/99658742973""},{""name"":""Wang Gao"",""id"":""/profile/99659130407""},{""name"":""Hua Wang"",""id"":""/profile/81485659695""},{""name"":""Yanchun Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81487649465""},{""name"":""Jiajia Huang"",""id"":""/profile/99658752464""},{""name"":""Qianqian Xie"",""id"":""/profile/99659195721""},{""name"":""Gang Hu"",""id"":""/profile/99659195693""},{""name"":""Gang Tian"",""id"":""/profile/99659195436""}]","[""Eugene Agichtein, Carlos Castillo, Debora Donato, Aristides Gionis, and Gilad Mishne. 2008.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3091995,Modeling and Mining Domain Shared Knowledge for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of user generated sentiment data (e.g., reviews, blogs). In real applications, these user-generated sentiment data can span so many different domains that it is difficult to label the training data for all of them. Therefore, we study the problem of sentiment classification adaptation task in this article. That is, a system is trained to label reviews from one source domain but is meant to be used on the target domain. One of the biggest challenges for sentiment classification adaptation task is how to deal with the problem when two data distributions between the source domain and target domain are significantly different from one another. However, our observation is that there might exist some domain shared knowledge among certain input dimensions of different domains. In this article, we present a novel method for modeling and mining the domain shared knowledge from different sentiment review domains via a joint non-negative matrix factorization–based framework. In this proposed framework, we attempt to learn the domain shared knowledge and the domain-specific information from different sentiment review domains with several various regularization constraints. The advantage of the proposed method can promote the correspondence under the topic space between the source domain and the target domain, which can significantly reduce the data distribution gap across two domains. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world balanced data sets from Amazon product reviews for sentence-level and document-level binary sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms several strong baselines and achieves an accuracy that is competitive with the most well-known methods for sentiment classification adaptation.","[{""name"":""Guang-You Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81486640560""},{""name"":""Jimmy Xiangji Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81100080207""},{""name"":""Guang-You Zhou"",""id"":""/profile/81486640560""},{""name"":""Jimmy Xiangji Huang"",""id"":""/profile/81100080207""}]","[""Ankit Agrawal, Zhengzhang Chen, Yu Cheng, Alok N.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3106371,What Does Affect the Correlation Among Evaluation Measures?,"Information Retrieval (IR) is well-known for the great number of adopted evaluation measures, with new ones popping up more and more frequently. In this context, correlation analysis is the tool used to study the evaluation measures and to let us understand if two measures rank systems similarly, if they grasp different aspects of system performances or actually reflect different user models, if a new measure is well motivated or not. To this end, the two most commonly used correlation coefficients are the Kendall’s τ correlation and the AP correlation τAP.The goal of the article is to investigate the properties of the tool, that is, correlation analysis, we use to study evaluation measures. In particular, we investigate three research questions about these two correlation coefficients: (i) what is the effect of the number of systems and topics? (ii) what is the effect of removing low-performing systems? (iii) what is the effect of the experimental collections?To answer these research questions, we propose a methodology based on General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) to isolate the effects of the number of topics, number of systems, and experimental collections and to let us observe expected correlation values, net from these effects, which are stable and reliable.We learned that the effect of the number of topics is more prominent than the effect of the number of systems. Even if it produces different absolute values, the effect of removing low-performing systems does not seem to provide information substantially different from not removing them, especially when comparing a whole set of evaluation measures. Finally, we found out that both document corpora and topic sets affect the correlation among evaluation measures, the effect of the latter being more prominent. Moreover, there is a substantial interaction between evaluation measures, corpora and topic sets, meaning that the correlation between different evaluation measures can be substantially increased or decreased depending on the different corpora and topics at hand.","[{""name"":""Nicola Ferro"",""id"":""/profile/81100482049""},{""name"":""Nicola Ferro"",""id"":""/profile/81100482049""}]","[""G.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3110217,AWARE: Exploiting Evaluation Measures to Combine Multiple Assessors,"We propose the Assessor-driven Weighted Averages for Retrieval Evaluation (AWARE) probabilistic framework, a novel methodology for dealing with multiple crowd assessors that may be contradictory and/or noisy. By modeling relevance judgements and crowd assessors as sources of uncertainty, AWARE takes the expectation of a generic performance measure, like Average Precision, composed with these random variables. In this way, it approaches the problem of aggregating different crowd assessors from a new perspective, that is, directly combining the performance measures computed on the ground truth generated by the crowd assessors instead of adopting some classification technique to merge the labels produced by them. We propose several unsupervised estimators that instantiate the AWARE framework and we compare them with state-of-the-art approaches, that is,Majoriity Vote and Expectation Maximization, on TREC collections. We found that AWARE approaches improve in terms of their capability of correctly ranking systems and predicting their actual performance scores.","[{""name"":""Marco Ferrante"",""id"":""/profile/81453608964""},{""name"":""Nicola Ferro"",""id"":""/profile/81100482049""},{""name"":""Maria Maistro"",""id"":""/profile/99658617884""},{""name"":""Marco Ferrante"",""id"":""/profile/81453608964""},{""name"":""Nicola Ferro"",""id"":""/profile/81100482049""},{""name"":""Maria Maistro"",""id"":""/profile/99658617884""}]","[""O.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3106372,Understanding and Leveraging the Impact of Response Latency on User Behaviour in Web Search,"The interplay between the response latency of web search systems and users’ search experience has only recently started to attract research attention, despite the important implications of response latency on monetisation of such systems. In this work, we carry out two complementary studies to investigate the impact of response latency on users’ searching behaviour in web search engines. We first conduct a controlled user study to investigate the sensitivity of users to increasing delays in response latency. This study shows that the users of a fast search system are more sensitive to delays than the users of a slow search system. Moreover, the study finds that users are more likely to notice the response latency delays beyond a certain latency threshold, their search experience potentially being affected. We then analyse a large number of search queries obtained from Yahoo Web Search to investigate the impact of response latency on users’ click behaviour. This analysis demonstrates the significant change in click behaviour as the response latency increases. We also find that certain user, context, and query attributes play a role in the way increasing response latency affects the click behaviour. To demonstrate a possible use case for our findings, we devise a machine-learning framework that leverages the latency impact, together with other features, to predict whether a user will issue any clicks on web search results. As a further extension of this use case, we investigate whether this machine-learning framework can be exploited to help search engines reduce their energy consumption during query processing.","[{""name"":""Xiao Bai"",""id"":""/profile/81490646220""},{""name"":""Ioannis Arapakis"",""id"":""/profile/81363606440""},{""name"":""B.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3108148,Local Representative-Based Matrix Factorization for Cold-Start Recommendation,"Cold-start recommendation is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. An important approach to cold-start recommendation is to conduct an interview for new users, called the interview-based approach. Among the interview-based methods, Representative-Based Matrix Factorization (RBMF) [24] provides an effective solution with appealing merits: it represents users over selected representative items, which makes the recommendations highly intuitive and interpretable. However, RBMF only utilizes a global set of representative items to model all users. Such a representation is somehow too strict and may not be flexible enough to capture varying users’ interests. To address this problem, we propose a novel interview-based model to dynamically create meaningful user groups using decision trees and then select local representative items for different groups. A two-round interview is performed for a new user. In the first round, l1 global questions are issued for group division, while in the second round, l2 local-group-specific questions are given to derive local representation. We collect the feedback on the (l1+l2) items to learn the user representations. By putting these steps together, we develop a joint optimization model, named local representative-based matrix factorization, for new user recommendations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with several competitive baselines.","[{""name"":""Lei Shi"",""id"":""/profile/99658698950""},{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Yi-Dong Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81450594087""},{""name"":""Lei Shi"",""id"":""/profile/99658698950""},{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Yi-Dong Shen"",""id"":""/profile/81450594087""}]","[""Michal Aharon, Oren Anava, Noa Avigdor-Elgrabli, Dana Drachsler-Cohen, Shahar Golan, and Oren Somekh. 2015.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3125620,"Suggesting Points-of-Interest via Content-Based, Collaborative, and Hybrid Fusion Methods in Mobile Devices","Recommending venues or points-of-interest (POIs) is a hot topic in recent years, especially for tourism applications and mobile users. We propose and evaluate several suggestion methods, taking an effectiveness, feasibility, efficiency, and privacy perspective. The task is addressed by two content-based methods (a Weighted kNN classifier and a Rated Rocchio personalized query), Collaborative Filtering methods, as well as several (rank-based or rating-based) methods of merging results of different systems. Effectiveness is evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets, provided and used by TREC’s Contextual Suggestion Tracks in 2015 and 2016. First, we enrich these datasets with more information on venues, collected from web services like Foursquare and Yelp; we make this extra data available for future experimentation. Then, we find that the content-based methods provide state-of-the-art effectiveness, the collaborative filtering variants mostly suffer from data sparsity problems in the current datasets, and the merging methods further improve results by mainly promoting the first relevant suggestion. Concerning mobile feasibility, efficiency, and user privacy, the content-based methods, especially Rated Rocchio, are the best. Collaborative filtering has the worst efficiency and privacy leaks. Our findings can be very useful for developing effective and efficient operational systems, respecting user privacy. Last, our experiments indicate that better benchmark datasets would be welcome, and the use of additional evaluation measures—more sensitive in recall—is recommended.","[{""name"":""Avi Arampatzis"",""id"":""/profile/81100125335""},{""name"":""Georgios Kalamatianos"",""id"":""/profile/99658747715""},{""name"":""Avi Arampatzis"",""id"":""/profile/81100125335""},{""name"":""Georgios Kalamatianos"",""id"":""/profile/99658747715""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2011.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3143802,Towards Efficient Framework for Time-Aware Spatial Keyword Queries on Road Networks,"The spatial keyword query takes as inputs a query location and a set of query keywords and returns the answer objects by considering both their spatial distances to the query location and textual similarity with the query keywords. However, temporal information plays an important role in the spatial keyword query (where there is, to our knowledge, no prior work considering temporal information of the objects), since objects are not always valid. For instance, visitors may plan their trips according to the opening hours of attractions. Moreover, in real-life applications, objects are located on a predefined road network, and the spatial proximity of two objects is measured by the shortest path distance or travelling time between them. In this article, we study the problem of time-aware spatial keyword (TSK) query, which assumes that objects are located on the road network, and finds the k objects satisfying users’ spatio-temporal description and textual constraint. We first present the pruning strategy and algorithm based on an existing index. Then, we design an efficient index structure called TG index and propose several algorithms using the TG index that can prune the search space with both spatio-temporal and textual information simultaneously. Further, we show that the TG index technique can also be applied to improve the performance of time-travel text search and spatial keyword query. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented index and algorithms.","[{""name"":""Jingwen Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659217732""},{""name"":""Yunjun Gao"",""id"":""/profile/81418596036""},{""name"":""Gang Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81318493491""},{""name"":""Rui Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659218406""},{""name"":""Jingwen Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/99659217732""},{""name"":""Yunjun Gao"",""id"":""/profile/81418596036""},{""name"":""Gang Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81318493491""},{""name"":""Rui Chen"",""id"":""/profile/99659218406""}]","[""Avishek Anand, Srikanta Bedathur, Klaus Berberich, and Ralf Schenkel. 2012.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3158671,Explicit Diversification of Event Aspects for Temporal Summarization,"During major events, such as emergencies and disasters, a large volume of information is reported on newswire and social media platforms. Temporal summarization (TS) approaches are used to automatically produce concise overviews of such events by extracting text snippets from related articles over time. Current TS approaches rely on a combination of event relevance and textual novelty for snippet selection. However, for events that span multiple days, textual novelty is often a poor criterion for selecting snippets, since many snippets are textually unique but are semantically redundant or non-informative. In this article, we propose a framework for the diversification of snippets using explicit event aspects, building on recent works in search result diversification. In particular, we first propose two techniques to identify explicit aspects that a user might want to see covered in a summary for different types of event. We then extend a state-of-the-art explicit diversification framework to maximize the coverage of these aspects when selecting summary snippets for unseen events. Through experimentation over the TREC TS 2013, 2014, and 2015 datasets, we show that explicit diversification for temporal summarization significantly outperforms classical novelty-based diversification, as the use of explicit event aspects reduces the amount of redundant and off-topic snippets returned, while also increasing summary timeliness.","[{""name"":""Richard McCreadie"",""id"":""/profile/81438596854""},{""name"":""Rodrygo L.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3156667,Exploiting User and Venue Characteristics for Fine-Grained Tweet Geolocation,"Which venue is a tweet posted from? We call this a fine-grained geolocation problem. Given an observed tweet, the task is to infer its discrete posting venue, e.g., a specific restaurant. This recovers the venue context and differs from prior work, which geolocats tweets to location coordinates or cities/neighborhoods.First, we conduct empirical analysis to uncover venue and user characteristics for improving geolocation. For venues, we observe spatial homophily, in which venues near each other have more similar tweet content (i.e., text representations) compared to venues further apart. For users, we observe that they are spatially focused and more likely to visit venues near their previous visits. We also find that a substantial proportion of users post one or more geocoded tweet(s), thus providing their location history data. We then propose geolocation models that exploit spatial homophily and spatial focus characteristics plus posting time information. Our models rank candidate venues of test tweets such that the actual posting venue is ranked high. To better tune model parameters, we introduce a learning-to-rank framework. Our best model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that tweets without any location-indicative words can be geolocated meaningfully as well.","[{""name"":""Wen-Haw Chong"",""id"":""/profile/99658741217""},{""name"":""Ee-Peng Lim"",""id"":""/profile/82258898657""},{""name"":""Wen-Haw Chong"",""id"":""/profile/99658741217""},{""name"":""Ee-Peng Lim"",""id"":""/profile/82258898657""}]","[""Amr Ahmed, Liangjie Hong, and Alexander J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3158670,Automatically Learning Topics and Difficulty Levels of Problems in Online Judge Systems,"Online Judge (OJ) systems have been widely used in many areas, including programming, mathematical problems solving, and job interviews. Unlike other online learning systems, such as Massive Open Online Course, most OJ systems are designed for self-directed learning without the intervention of teachers. Also, in most OJ systems, problems are simply listed in volumes and there is no clear organization of them by topics or difficulty levels. As such, problems in the same volume are mixed in terms of topics or difficulty levels. By analyzing large-scale users’ learning traces, we observe that there are two major learning modes (or patterns). Users either practice problems in a sequential manner from the same volume regardless of their topics or they attempt problems about the same topic, which may spread across multiple volumes. Our observation is consistent with the findings in classic educational psychology. Based on our observation, we propose a novel two-mode Markov topic model to automatically detect the topics of online problems by jointly characterizing the two learning modes. For further predicting the difficulty level of online problems, we propose a competition-based expertise model using the learned topic information. Extensive experiments on three large OJ datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in three different tasks, including skill topic extraction, expertise competition prediction and problem recommendation.","[{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Wenhui Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659069740""},{""name"":""Yulan He"",""id"":""/profile/81472646678""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Ji-Rong Wen"",""id"":""/profile/81100357094""},{""name"":""Wayne Xin Zhao"",""id"":""/profile/81472652704""},{""name"":""Wenhui Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/99659069740""},{""name"":""Yulan He"",""id"":""/profile/81472646678""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Ji-Rong Wen"",""id"":""/profile/81100357094""}]","[""Ashton Anderson, Daniel Huttenlocher, Jon Kleinberg, and Jure Leskovec. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3158672,Selective Cluster Presentation on the Search Results Page,"Web search engines present, for some queries, a cluster of results from the same specialized domain (“vertical”) on the search results page (SERP). We introduce a comprehensive analysis of the presentation of such clusters from seven different verticals based on the logs of a commercial Web search engine. This analysis reveals several unique characteristics—such as size, rank, and clicks—of result clusters from community question-and-answer websites. The study of properties of this result cluster—specifically as part of the SERP—has received little attention in previous work. Our analysis also motivates the pursuit of a long-standing challenge in ad hoc retrieval, namely, selective cluster retrieval. In our setting, the specific challenge is to select for presentation the documents most highly ranked either by a cluster-based approach (those in the top-retrieved cluster) or by a document-based approach. We address this classification task by representing queries with features based on those utilized for ranking the clusters, query-performance predictors, and properties of the document-clustering structure. Empirical evaluation performed with TREC data shows that our approach outperforms a recently proposed state-of-the-art cluster-based document-retrieval method as well as state-of-the-art document-retrieval methods that do not account for inter-document similarities.","[{""name"":""Or Levi"",""id"":""/profile/99659082113""},{""name"":""Ido Guy"",""id"":""/profile/81321492044""},{""name"":""Fiana Raiber"",""id"":""/profile/81472653708""},{""name"":""Oren Kurland"",""id"":""/profile/81100462276""},{""name"":""Or Levi"",""id"":""/profile/99659082113""},{""name"":""Ido Guy"",""id"":""/profile/81321492044""},{""name"":""Fiana Raiber"",""id"":""/profile/81472653708""},{""name"":""Oren Kurland"",""id"":""/profile/81100462276""}]","[""Nasreen Abdul-Jaleel, James Allan, W.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3183712,Joint Modeling of Participant Influence and Latent Topics for Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks,"Event-based social networks (EBSNs) are becoming popular in recent years. Users can publish a planned event on an EBSN website, calling for other users to participate in the event. When a user is making a decision on whether to participate in an event in EBSNs, one aspect for consideration is existing participants defined as users who have agreed to join this event. Existing participants of the event may affect the decision of the user, to which we refer as participant influence. However, participant influence is not well studied by previous works. In this article, we propose an event recommendation model that considers participant influence, and exploits the influence of existing participants on the decisions of new participants based on Poisson factorization. The effect of participant influence is associated with the target event, the host group of the event, and the location of the event. Furthermore, our proposed model can extract latent event topics from event text descriptions, and characterize events, groups, and locations by distributions of event topics. Associations between latent event topics and participant influence are exploited for improving event recommendation. Besides making event recommendation, the proposed model is able to reveal the semantic properties of the participant influence between two users semantically. We have conducted extensive experiments on some datasets extracted from a real-world EBSN. Our proposed model achieves superior event recommendation performance over several state-of-the-art models. The results demonstrate that the consideration of participant influence can improve event recommendation.","[{""name"":""Yi Liao"",""id"":""/profile/99658749626""},{""name"":""Wai Lam"",""id"":""/profile/81423592360""},{""name"":""Lidong Bing"",""id"":""/profile/81472641204""},{""name"":""Xin Shen"",""id"":""/profile/99659249152""},{""name"":""Yi Liao"",""id"":""/profile/99658749626""},{""name"":""Wai Lam"",""id"":""/profile/81423592360""},{""name"":""Lidong Bing"",""id"":""/profile/81472641204""},{""name"":""Xin Shen"",""id"":""/profile/99659249152""}]","[""Marko Balabanović and Yoav Shoham. 1997.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3182163,The Characteristics of Voice Search: Comparing Spoken with Typed-in Mobile Web Search Queries,"The growing popularity of mobile search and the advancement in voice recognition technologies have opened the door for web search users to speak their queries rather than type them. While this kind of voice search is still in its infancy, it is gradually becoming more widespread. In this article, we report a comprehensive voice search query log analysis of a commercial web search engine’s mobile application. We compare voice and text search by various aspects, with special focus on the semantic and syntactic characteristics of the queries. Our analysis suggests that voice queries focus more on audio-visual content and question answering and less on social networking and adult domains. In addition, voice queries are more commonly submitted on the go. We also conduct an empirical evaluation showing that the language of voice queries is closer to natural language than the language of text queries. Our analysis points out further differences between voice and text search. We discuss the implications of these differences for the design of future voice-enabled web search tools.","[{""name"":""Ido Guy"",""id"":""/profile/81321492044""},{""name"":""Ido Guy"",""id"":""/profile/81321492044""}]","[""A.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3182164,CO2: Inferring Personal Interests From Raw Footprints by Connecting the Offline World with the Online World,"User-generated trajectories (UGTs), such as travel records from bus companies, capture rich information of human mobility in the offline world. However, some interesting applications of these raw footprints have not been exploited well due to the lack of textual information to infer the subject’s personal interests. Although there is rich semantic information contained in the spatial- and temporal-aware user-generated contents (STUGC) published in the online world, such as Twitter, less effort has been made to utilize this information to facilitate the interest discovery process. In this article, we design an effective probabilistic framework named CO2 to <underline>c</underline>onnect the <underline>o</underline>ffline world with the <underline>o</underline>nline world in order to discover users’ interests directly from their raw footprints in UGT. CO2 first infers trip intentions by utilizing the semantic information in STUGC and then discovers user interests by aggregating the intentions. To evaluate the effectiveness of CO2, we use two large-scale real-world datasets as a case study and further conduct a questionnaire survey to show the superior performance of CO2.","[{""name"":""Long Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99658655755""},{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Yuan Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659065390""},{""name"":""Huayu Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659249500""},{""name"":""Bin Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81100229109""},{""name"":""Kian-Lee Tan"",""id"":""/profile/81502695037""},{""name"":""Long Guo"",""id"":""/profile/99658655755""},{""name"":""Dongxiang Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81472652388""},{""name"":""Yuan Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659065390""},{""name"":""Huayu Wu"",""id"":""/profile/99659249500""},{""name"":""Bin Cui"",""id"":""/profile/81100229109""},{""name"":""Kian-Lee Tan"",""id"":""/profile/81502695037""}]","[""David J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3182165,Unsupervised Learning of Parsimonious General-Purpose Embeddings for User and Location Modeling,"Many social network applications depend on robust representations of spatio-temporal data. In this work, we present an embedding model based on feed-forward neural networks which transforms social media check-ins into dense feature vectors encoding geographic, temporal, and functional aspects for modeling places, neighborhoods, and users. We employ the embedding model in a variety of applications including location recommendation, urban functional zone study, and crime prediction. For location recommendation, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Embedding Similarity algorithm (STES) based on the embedding model.In a range of experiments on real life data collected from Foursquare, we demonstrate our model’s effectiveness at characterizing places and people and its applicability in aforementioned problem domains. Finally, we select eight major cities around the globe and verify the robustness and generality of our model by porting pre-trained models from one city to another, thereby alleviating the need for costly local training.","[{""name"":""Jing Yang"",""id"":""/profile/99658983074""},{""name"":""Carsten Eickhoff"",""id"":""/profile/81472656672""},{""name"":""Jing Yang"",""id"":""/profile/99658983074""},{""name"":""Carsten Eickhoff"",""id"":""/profile/81472656672""}]","[""Jie Bao, Yu Zheng, and Mohamed F.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3182166,GeoMF++: Scalable Location Recommendation via Joint Geographical Modeling and Matrix Factorization,"Location recommendation is an important means to help people discover attractive locations. However, extreme sparsity of user-location matrices leads to a severe challenge, so it is necessary to take implicit feedback characteristics of user mobility data into account and leverage the location’s spatial information. To this end, based on previously developed GeoMF, we propose a scalable and flexible framework, dubbed GeoMF++, for joint geographical modeling and implicit feedback-based matrix factorization. We then develop an efficient optimization algorithm for parameter learning, which scales linearly with data size and the total number of neighbor grids of all locations. GeoMF++ can be well explained from two perspectives. First, it subsumes two-dimensional kernel density estimation so that it captures spatial clustering phenomenon in user mobility data; Second, it is strongly connected with widely used neighbor additive models, graph Laplacian regularized models, and collective matrix factorization. Finally, we extensively evaluate GeoMF++ on two large-scale LBSN datasets. The experimental results show that GeoMF++ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art and other competing baselines on both datasets in terms of NDCG and Recall. Besides, the efficiency studies show that GeoMF++ is much more scalable with the increase of data size and the dimension of latent space.","[{""name"":""Defu Lian"",""id"":""/profile/81490653988""},{""name"":""Kai Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659045105""},{""name"":""Yong Ge"",""id"":""/profile/81496674732""},{""name"":""Longbing Cao"",""id"":""/profile/99659079573""},{""name"":""Enhong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81323488612""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""},{""name"":""Defu Lian"",""id"":""/profile/81490653988""},{""name"":""Kai Zheng"",""id"":""/profile/99659045105""},{""name"":""Yong Ge"",""id"":""/profile/81496674732""},{""name"":""Longbing Cao"",""id"":""/profile/99659079573""},{""name"":""Enhong Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81323488612""},{""name"":""Xing Xie"",""id"":""/profile/81385598345""}]","[""Deepak Agarwal and Bee-Chung Chen. 2009.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3183370,QuoteRec: Toward Quote Recommendation for Writing,"Quote is a language phenomenon of transcribing the statement of someone else, such as a proverb and a famous saying. An appropriate usage of quote usually equips the expression with more elegance and credibility. However, there are times when we are eager to stress our idea by citing a quote, while nothing relevant comes to mind. Therefore, it is exciting to have a recommender system which provides quote recommendations while we are writing. This article extends previous study of quote recommendation, the task that recommends the appropriate quote according to the context (i.e., the content occurring before and after the quote). In this article, a quote recommender system called QuoteRec is presented to tackle the task. We investigate two models to learn the vector representations of quotes and contexts, and then rank the candidate quotes based on the representations. The first model learns the quote representation according to the contexts of a quote. The second model is an extension of the neural network model in previous study, which learns the representation of a quote by concerning both its content and contexts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two models in learning the semantic representations of quotes, and the neural network model achieves state-of-the-art results on the quote recommendation task.","[{""name"":""Jiwei Tan"",""id"":""/profile/99658731790""},{""name"":""Xiaojun Wan"",""id"":""/profile/81339534515""},{""name"":""Hui Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659254197""},{""name"":""Jianguo Xiao"",""id"":""/profile/81330500318""},{""name"":""Jiwei Tan"",""id"":""/profile/99658731790""},{""name"":""Xiaojun Wan"",""id"":""/profile/81339534515""},{""name"":""Hui Liu"",""id"":""/profile/99659254197""},{""name"":""Jianguo Xiao"",""id"":""/profile/81330500318""}]","[""Yeonchan Ahn, Hanbit Lee, Heesik Jeon, Seungdo Ha, and Sang-goo Lee. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3185153,Swipe and Tell: Using Implicit Feedback to Predict User Engagement on Tablets,"When content consumers explicitly judge content positively, we consider them to be engaged. Unfortunately, explicit user evaluations are difficult to collect, as they require user effort. Therefore, we propose to use device interactions as implicit feedback to detect engagement.We assess the usefulness of swipe interactions on tablets for predicting engagement and make the comparison with using traditional features based on time spent.We gathered two unique datasets of more than 250,000 swipes, 100,000 unique article visits, and over 35,000 explicitly judged news articles by modifying two commonly used tablet apps of two newspapers. We tracked all device interactions of 407 experiment participants during one month of habitual news reading.We employed a behavioral metric as a proxy for engagement, because our analysis needed to be scalable to many users, and scanning behavior required us to allow users to indicate engagement quickly.We point out the importance of taking into account content ordering, report the most predictive features, zoom in on briefly read content and on the most frequently read articles.Our findings demonstrate that fine-grained tablet interactions are useful indicators of engagement for newsreaders on tablets. The best features successfully combine both time-based aspects and swipe interactions.","[{""name"":""Klaas Nelissen"",""id"":""/profile/99659276385""},{""name"":""Monique Snoeck"",""id"":""/profile/81100435535""},{""name"":""Seppe Vanden Broucke"",""id"":""/profile/81482660516""},{""name"":""Bart Baesens"",""id"":""/profile/81100467552""},{""name"":""Klaas Nelissen"",""id"":""/profile/99659276385""},{""name"":""Monique Snoeck"",""id"":""/profile/81100435535""},{""name"":""Seppe Vanden Broucke"",""id"":""/profile/81482660516""},{""name"":""Bart Baesens"",""id"":""/profile/81100467552""}]","[""E.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3186195,Further Insights on Drawing Sound Conclusions from Noisy Judgments,"The effectiveness of a search engine is typically evaluated using hand-labeled datasets, where the labels indicate the relevance of documents to queries. Often the number of labels needed is too large to be created by the best annotators, and so less expensive labels (e.g., from crowdsourcing) are used. This introduces errors in the labels, and thus errors in standard effectiveness metrics (such as [email protected] and DCG). These errors must be taken into consideration when using the metrics. Previous work has approached assessor error by taking aggregates over multiple inexpensive assessors. We take a different approach and introduce equations and algorithms that can adjust the metrics to the values they would have had if there were no annotation errors.This is especially important when two search engines are compared on their metrics. We give examples where one engine appeared to be statistically significantly better than the other, but the effect disappeared after the metrics were corrected for annotation error. In other words, the evidence supporting a statistical difference was illusory and caused by a failure to account for annotation error.","[{""name"":""David Goldberg"",""id"":""/profile/81410594782""},{""name"":""Andrew Trotman"",""id"":""/profile/81100269573""},{""name"":""Xiao Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659153620""},{""name"":""Wei Min"",""id"":""/profile/99659152913""},{""name"":""Zongru Wan"",""id"":""/profile/99659153983""},{""name"":""David Goldberg"",""id"":""/profile/81410594782""},{""name"":""Andrew Trotman"",""id"":""/profile/81100269573""},{""name"":""Xiao Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659153620""},{""name"":""Wei Min"",""id"":""/profile/99659152913""},{""name"":""Zongru Wan"",""id"":""/profile/99659153983""}]","[""Ittai Abraham, Omar Alonso, Vasilis Kandylas, Rajesh Patel, Steven Shelford, and Aleksandrs Slivkins. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3190784,An Integrated Signature-Based Framework for Efficient Visual Similarity Detection and Measurement in Video Shots,"This article presents a framework for speedy video matching and retrieval through detection and measurement of visual similarity. The framework’s efficiency stems from its power to encode a given shot content into a compact fixed-length signature that helps in robust real-time matching. Separate scene and motion signatures are developed and fused together to fully represent and match respective video shots. Scene information is captured through the Statistical Dominant Color Profile (SDCP), while motion information is captured through a graph-based signature called the Dominant Color Graph Profile (DCGP). The SDCP is a fixed-length compact signature that statistically encodes the colors’ spatiotemporal patterns across video frames. The DCGP is a fixed-length signature that records and tracks the gray levels across subsampled video frames, where the graph structural properties are used to extract the signature values. Finally, the overall video signature is generated by fusing the individual scene and motion signatures. The signature-based aspect of the proposed framework is the key to its high matching speed (> 2000 fps) compared to current techniques that rely on exhaustive processing. To maximize the benefit of the framework, compressed-domain videos are utilized as a case study following their wide availability. However, the framework avoids full video decompression and operates on tiny frames rather than full-size decompressed frames. Experiments on various standard and challenging dataset groups show the framework’s robust performance in terms of both retrieval and computational performance.","[{""name"":""Saddam Bekhet"",""id"":""/profile/99658668904""},{""name"":""Amr Ahmed"",""id"":""/profile/81335487631""},{""name"":""Saddam Bekhet"",""id"":""/profile/99658668904""},{""name"":""Amr Ahmed"",""id"":""/profile/81335487631""}]","[""Kazuaki Aihara and Terumasa Aoki. 2015.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3196826,Neural Vector Spaces for Unsupervised Information Retrieval,"We propose the Neural Vector Space Model (NVSM), a method that learns representations of documents in an unsupervised manner for news article retrieval. In the NVSM paradigm, we learn low-dimensional representations of words and documents from scratch using gradient descent and rank documents according to their similarity with query representations that are composed from word representations. We show that NVSM performs better at document ranking than existing latent semantic vector space methods. The addition of NVSM to a mixture of lexical language models and a state-of-the-art baseline vector space model yields a statistically significant increase in retrieval effectiveness. Consequently, NVSM adds a complementary relevance signal. Next to semantic matching, we find that NVSM performs well in cases where lexical matching is needed. NVSM learns a notion of term specificity directly from the document collection without feature engineering. We also show that NVSM learns regularities related to Luhn significance. Finally, we give advice on how to deploy NVSM in situations where model selection (e.g., cross-validation) is infeasible. We find that an unsupervised ensemble of multiple models trained with different hyperparameter values performs better than a single cross-validated model. Therefore, NVSM can safely be used for ranking documents without supervised relevance judgments.","[{""name"":""Christophe Van Gysel"",""id"":""/profile/99658750892""},{""name"":""Maarten de Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Evangelos Kanoulas"",""id"":""/profile/81100071997""},{""name"":""Christophe Van Gysel"",""id"":""/profile/99658750892""},{""name"":""Maarten de Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Evangelos Kanoulas"",""id"":""/profile/81100071997""}]","[""Martín Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3200864,Sentence Relations for Extractive Summarization with Deep Neural Networks,"Sentence regression is a type of extractive summarization that achieves state-of-the-art performance and is commonly used in practical systems. The most challenging task within the sentence regression framework is to identify discriminative features to represent each sentence. In this article, we study the use of sentence relations, e.g., Contextual Sentence Relations (CSR), Title Sentence Relations (TSR), and Query Sentence Relations (QSR), so as to improve the performance of sentence regression. CSR, TSR, and QSR refer to the relations between a main body sentence and its local context, its document title, and a given query, respectively.We propose a deep neural network model, Sentence Relation-based Summarization (SRSum), that consists of five sub-models, PriorSum, CSRSum, TSRSum, QSRSum, and SFSum. PriorSum encodes the latent semantic meaning of a sentence using a bi-gram convolutional neural network. SFSum encodes the surface information of a sentence, e.g., sentence length, sentence position, and so on. CSRSum, TSRSum, and QSRSum are three sentence relation sub-models corresponding to CSR, TSR, and QSR, respectively. CSRSum evaluates the ability of each sentence to summarize its local contexts. Specifically, CSRSum applies a CSR-based word-level and sentence-level attention mechanism to simulate the context-aware reading of a human reader, where words and sentences that have anaphoric relations or local summarization abilities are easily remembered and paid attention to. TSRSum evaluates the semantic closeness of each sentence with respect to its title, which usually reflects the main ideas of a document. TSRSum applies a TSR-based attention mechanism to simulate people’s reading ability with the main idea (title) in mind. QSRSum evaluates the relevance of each sentence with given queries for the query-focused summarization. QSRSum applies a QSR-based attention mechanism to simulate the attentive reading of a human reader with some queries in mind. The mechanism can recognize which parts of the given queries are more likely answered by a sentence under consideration. Finally as a whole, SRSum automatically learns useful latent features by jointly learning representations of query sentences, content sentences, and title sentences as well as their relations.We conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including generic multi-document summarization and query-focused multi-document summarization. On both tasks, SRSum achieves comparable or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple ROUGE metrics.","[{""name"":""Pengjie Ren"",""id"":""/profile/99658769743""},{""name"":""Zhumin Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81435601713""},{""name"":""Zhaochun Ren"",""id"":""/profile/82458722457""},{""name"":""Furu Wei"",""id"":""/profile/81363592787""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Maarten de Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""},{""name"":""Pengjie Ren"",""id"":""/profile/99658769743""},{""name"":""Zhumin Chen"",""id"":""/profile/81435601713""},{""name"":""Zhaochun Ren"",""id"":""/profile/82458722457""},{""name"":""Furu Wei"",""id"":""/profile/81363592787""},{""name"":""Liqiang Nie"",""id"":""/profile/81466646445""},{""name"":""Jun Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81384604652""},{""name"":""Maarten de Rijke"",""id"":""/profile/81335489572""}]","[""Regina Barzilay, Noemie Elhadad, and Kathleen R.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3202662,"Location Extraction from Social Media: Geoparsing, Location Disambiguation, and Geotagging","Location extraction, also called “toponym extraction,” is a field covering geoparsing, extracting spatial representations from location mentions in text, and geotagging, assigning spatial coordinates to content items. This article evaluates five “best-of-class” location extraction algorithms. We develop a geoparsing algorithm using an OpenStreetMap database, and a geotagging algorithm using a language model constructed from social media tags and multiple gazetteers. Third-party work evaluated includes a DBpedia-based entity recognition and disambiguation approach, a named entity recognition and Geonames gazetteer approach, and a Google Geocoder API approach. We perform two quantitative benchmark evaluations, one geoparsing tweets and one geotagging Flickr posts, to compare all approaches. We also perform a qualitative evaluation recalling top N location mentions from tweets during major news events. The OpenStreetMap approach was best (F1 0.90+) for geoparsing English, and the language model approach was best (F1 0.66) for Turkish. The language model was best ([email protected] 0.49) for the geotagging evaluation. The map database was best ([email protected] 0.60+) in the qualitative evaluation. We report on strengths, weaknesses, and a detailed failure analysis for the approaches and suggest concrete areas for further research.","[{""name"":""Stuart E.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3209624,"Factors Influencing Users’ Information Requests: Medium, Target, and Extra-Topical Dimension","We report on a crowdsourced study that investigated how two factors influence the way people formulate information requests. Our first factor, medium, considers whether the request is produced using text or voice. Our second factor, target, considers whether the request is intended for a search engine or a human intermediary (i.e., someone who will search on the user’s behalf). In particular, we study how these two factors influence the way people formulate requests in situations where the information need has a specific type of extra-topical dimension (i.e., a type of constraint that is independent from the information need’s topic). We focus on six extra-topical dimensions: (1) domain knowledge, (2) viewpoint, (3) experiential, (4) venue location, (5) source location, and (6) temporal. The extra-topical dimension was manipulated by giving participants carefully constructed search tasks. We analyzed a large number of information requests produced by study participants, and address three research questions. We study the effects of our two factors (medium and target) on (RQ1) participants’ perceptions about their own information requests, (RQ2) the different characteristics of their information requests (e.g., natural language structure, retrieval performance), and (RQ3) participants’ strategies for requesting information when the search task has a specific type of extra-topical dimension. Our results found that both factors influenced participants’ perceptions about their own information requests, the characteristics of participants’ requests, and the strategies adopted by participants to request information matching the extra-topical dimension. Our results have implications for future research on methods that can harness (rather than ignore) extra-topical query terms to retrieve relevant information.","[{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Bogeum Choi"",""id"":""/profile/99659281714""},{""name"":""Robert Capra"",""id"":""/profile/81100419460""},{""name"":""Jaime Arguello"",""id"":""/profile/81311482029""},{""name"":""Bogeum Choi"",""id"":""/profile/99659281714""},{""name"":""Robert Capra"",""id"":""/profile/81100419460""}]","[""Jaime Arguello, Sandeep Avula, and Fernando Diaz. 2016.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3223045,How Does Domain Expertise Affect Users’ Search Interaction and Outcome in Exploratory Search?,"People often conduct exploratory search to explore unfamiliar information space and learn new knowledge. While supporting the highly dynamic and interactive exploratory search is still challenging for the search system, we want to investigate which factors can make the exploratory search successful and satisfying from the user’s perspective. Previous research suggests that domain experts have different search strategies and are more successful in finding domain-specific information, but how the domain expertise level will influence users’ interaction and search outcomes in exploratory search, especially in different knowledge domains, is still unclear. In this work, via a carefully designed user study that involves 30 participants, we investigate the influence of domain expertise levels on the interaction and outcome of exploratory search in three different domains: environment, medicine, and politics. We record participants’ search behaviors, including their explicit feedback and eye fixation sequences, in a laboratory setting. With this dataset, we identify both domain-independent and domain-dependent effects on user behaviors and search outcomes. Our results extend existing research on the effect of domain expertise in search and suggest different strategies for exploiting domain expertise to support exploratory search in different knowledge domains.","[{""name"":""Jiaxin Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99659048090""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Noriko Kando"",""id"":""/profile/81100253509""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""},{""name"":""Jiaxin Mao"",""id"":""/profile/99659048090""},{""name"":""Yiqun Liu"",""id"":""/profile/81100537648""},{""name"":""Noriko Kando"",""id"":""/profile/81100253509""},{""name"":""Min Zhang"",""id"":""/profile/81423595921""},{""name"":""Shaoping Ma"",""id"":""/profile/81100447859""}]","[""John R.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3230871,Location-aware Influence Maximization over Dynamic Social Streams,"Influence maximization (IM), which selects a set of k seed users (a.k.a., a seed set) to maximize the influence spread over a social network, is a fundamental problem in a wide range of applications. However, most existing IM algorithms are static and location-unaware. They fail to provide high-quality seed sets efficiently when the social network evolves rapidly and IM queries are location-aware. In this article, we first define two IM queries, namely Stream Influence Maximization (SIM) and Location-aware SIM (LSIM), to track influential users over social streams. Technically, SIM adopts the sliding window model and maintains a seed set with the maximum influence value collectively over the most recent social actions. LSIM further considers social actions are associated with geo-tags and identifies a seed set that maximizes the influence value in a query region over a location-aware social stream. Then, we propose the Sparse Influential Checkpoints (SIC) framework for efficient SIM query processing. SIC maintains a sequence of influential checkpoints over the sliding window and each checkpoint maintains a partial solution for SIM in an append-only substream of social actions. Theoretically, SIC keeps a logarithmic number of checkpoints w.r.t. the size of the sliding window and always returns an approximate solution from one of the checkpoint for the SIM query at any time. Furthermore, we propose the Location-based SIC (LSIC) framework and its improved version LSIC+, both of which process LSIM queries by integrating the SIC framework with a Quadtree spatial index. LSIC can provide approximate solutions for both ad hoc and continuous LSIM queries in real time, while LSIC+ further improves the solution quality of LSIC. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed frameworks against the state-of-the-art IM algorithms.","[{""name"":""Yanhao Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659144423""},{""name"":""Yuchen Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658725921""},{""name"":""Ju Fan"",""id"":""/profile/81387593229""},{""name"":""Kian-Lee Tan"",""id"":""/profile/81451597529""},{""name"":""Yanhao Wang"",""id"":""/profile/99659144423""},{""name"":""Yuchen Li"",""id"":""/profile/99658725921""},{""name"":""Ju Fan"",""id"":""/profile/81387593229""},{""name"":""Kian-Lee Tan"",""id"":""/profile/81451597529""}]","[""Charu C.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3231593,Interactive Intent Modeling for Exploratory Search,"Exploratory search requires the system to assist the user in comprehending the information space and expressing evolving search intents for iterative exploration and retrieval of information. We introduce interactive intent modeling, a technique that models a user’s evolving search intents and visualizes them as keywords for interaction. The user can provide feedback on the keywords, from which the system learns and visualizes an improved intent estimate and retrieves information. We report experiments comparing variants of a system implementing interactive intent modeling to a control system. Data comprising search logs, interaction logs, essay answers, and questionnaires indicate significant improvements in task performance, information retrieval performance over the session, information comprehension performance, and user experience. The improvements in retrieval effectiveness can be attributed to the intent modeling and the effect on users’ task performance, breadth of information comprehension, and user experience are shown to be dependent on a richer visualization. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining interactive modeling of search intentions with interactive visualization of the models that can benefit both directing the exploratory search process and making sense of the information space. Our findings can help design personalized systems that support exploratory information seeking and discovery of novel information.","[{""name"":""Tuukka Ruotsalo"",""id"":""/profile/81339525898""},{""name"":""Jaakko Peltonen"",""id"":""/profile/81100125974""},{""name"":""Manuel J.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3231933,Personalized Context-Aware Point of Interest Recommendation,"Personalized recommendation of Points of Interest (POIs) plays a key role in satisfying users on Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). In this article, we propose a probabilistic model to find the mapping between user-annotated tags and locations’ taste keywords. Furthermore, we introduce a dataset on locations’ contextual appropriateness and demonstrate its usefulness in predicting the contextual relevance of locations. We investigate four approaches to use our proposed mapping for addressing the data sparsity problem: one model to reduce the dimensionality of location taste keywords and three models to predict user tags for a new location. Moreover, we present different scores calculated from multiple LBSNs and show how we incorporate new information from the mapping into a POI recommendation approach. Then, the computed scores are integrated using learning to rank techniques. The experiments on two TREC datasets show the effectiveness of our approach, beating state-of-the-art methods.","[{""name"":""Mohammad Aliannejadi"",""id"":""/profile/99659037739""},{""name"":""Fabio Crestani"",""id"":""/profile/81100211564""},{""name"":""Mohammad Aliannejadi"",""id"":""/profile/99659037739""},{""name"":""Fabio Crestani"",""id"":""/profile/81100211564""}]","[""Gediminas Adomavicius, Ramesh Sankaranarayanan, Shahana Sen, and Alexander Tuzhilin. 2005.
